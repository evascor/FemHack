In Ontario alone, an estimated 650,000 families are dealing with the unique challenges and struggles of raising children and youth with mental illness. Suicide is currently the leading cause of non-accidental death among children and youth in Ontario, claiming the lives of children and youth more than any physical illness.

There is still a stigma surrounding mental illness. For example, 49% of people who feel as though they have suffered from depression or anxiety have never gone to see a doctor about this problem. 42% of Canadians were unsure whether they would socialize with a friend who has a mental illness and 55% of Canadians said they would be unlikely to enter a spousal relationship with someone who has a mental illness.

I feel that having a mandatory course in high school in mental health will help to relieve this stigma around mental illness. Also adolescents will learn more about issues they may be dealing with or know someone who is dealing with it. This will also help them to find different resources or learn of places to get help."

4,Chiedere alle Nazioni Unite che il 2018 sia l'ANNO INTERNAZIONALE DELLE MIGRAZIONI,"population?- induced as they are by violence, land/water grabbing phenomena, climate change, the inability","['Petizione diretta a Assemblea Generale Nazioni Unite', ""Consiglio dell'Unione Europea"", 'European Parliament', 'United Nations', 'Commissione Europea', 'Ministero degli Affari Esteri italiano']",Cristiana Fiamingo,"Università degli Studi di Milano, Italia",436,Data di lancio 27 lug 2017,https://assets.change.org/photos/3/fd/wb/CjfdwBgnWoQItls-800x450-noPad.jpg?1510752364,"[ITA] Se osservate la lista delle annate internazionali promosse delle Nazioni Unite, sebbene sia stato già deciso il tema del 2019, non è ancora stato deciso il tema internazionale del 2018. Un aspetto positivo del dedicare un'annata ad un problema, a livello internazionale, è che induce a sviscerarlo ai più alti livelli e secondo le più diverse prospettive. I problemi mondiali sono finalmente messi sotto i riflettori in tutto il mondo. Uno dei problemi più dibattuti e che ci riguarda da vicino è certo quello delle MIGRAZIONI, ma, colpevoli la maggior parte dei media di bassa qualità e politici che non hanno le capacità di ideare proposte politiche nuove, la logica del NIMB (not in my backyard - non nel mio cortile) e miti senza fondamento deflagrano polverizzando opinioni ed idee nei Paesi di accoglienza che impediscono di far emergere orientamenti politici sostenibili e responsabilità. Sovrastano il tutto le posizioni nazionaliste che, drastiche, non risolvono i problemi, ma innalzano muri spezzando il sogno di una convivenza armoniosa per cui si forgiano organizzazioni regionali. Con ostinazione, non si vuole dare l'importanza che ha a questo problema, anche perchè le stesse Organizzazioni Internazionali dovrebbero ammettere le proprie responsabilità nel non intervenire mai stigmatizzando i comportamenti di gruppi economici che mal operano all'estero e di quei governi che inducono i propri cittadini alla fuga, prendendo le misure necessarie e vincolanti. Ma poi, miei concittadini Europei, Vi pare possibile che il 2018 per l'Europa sia l'anno del patrimonio culturale? E' certo importante (ci ho anche scritto un libro su) ma non vi sembra che sia maggiormente impellente coordinare una direttrice politica europea e mondiale per contenere la pulsione alla fuga di una buona parte della popolazione mondiale - indotta da violenze, fenomeni di land/water grabbing, cambiamenti climatici, incapacità di assicurare opportunità di lavoro dai loro governi - , da parte dell'organizzazione regionale che ha il più alto numero di transazioni con i Paesi di provenienza dei migranti e del più alto numero di morti nel suo mare, anche a causa di questo? Non è certo una soluzione quella di pagar mazzette ai Paesi-ponte a che trattengano nei loro lager chi aspira ad una vita migliore per sè e per i propri figli, ma piuttosto si dovrebbero cercare soluzioni politiche che risolvano alla base i problemi nei Paesi di provenienza, anche pervenendo ad accordi di co-sviluppo sostenibili e corretti. Si tratta di riprogettare tutta la politica estera mondiale, altro che ""aiutiamoli a casa loro""! Occorre offrire soluzioni complesse coordinate con gli altri Stati per far star meglio tutti. Nella prospettiva di una crisi mondiale che interessa tutta l'umanità e non le solo coste italiane o greche ed i nostri dirimpettai, Vi esorto a sostenere questa petizione.  FACCIAMO CHE IL 2018 SIA L'ANNO INTERNAZIONALE DEL MIGRANTE INTERNAZIONALE!

[ENGL] If you look at the UN list of the International Years, although the theme of the International Year 2019 has already been decided, the 2018 International theme has not been established yet. A positive aspect of dedicating a year to a problem at an international level is that it compels the dissection and analysis at the highest level and in the most diverse perspectives. World problems are finally put under the spotlight around the world. One of the most debated issues we are involved in is certainly that of MIGRATIONS, but because of the low quality media and politicians who have no ability to design new policy proposals, the logic of NIMBY (not in my backyard) and unfounded myths deflagrate pulverizing views and ideas in the host countries that prevent the emergence of sustainable political guidelines and responsibilities. Thus what gains the high ground are the nationalist positions that, drastic, do not solve the problems but raise walls breaking the dream of a harmonious coexistence for which regional organizations are conceived. With obstinacy  this problem is not given the importance it deserves, even because the International Organisations themselves would have to admit their responsibilities in never intervening, stigmatizing the behaviour of economic groups that are operating badly abroad and of those governments that induce their own people to flee, and take the necessary, binding measures. For those who think I am aiming too high, then, my European fellow citizens, is it possible that 2018 is elected by the European commission the year of ""cultural heritage""? Doubtless, it is a very important topic (I have also edited a book on it) but doesn't it seem to be more urgent to coordinate a European and World policy direction to contain the drive to flee gripping a large part of the world's population?- induced as they are by violence, land/water grabbing phenomena, climate change, the inability to provide job opportunities on behalf of their governments. Shouldn't  the REC (regional economic community) that has the highest number of transactions with the migrants' countries of origin, and of the highest number of deaths in its sea come up with some solutions? It is certainly not a solution to pay backhanders to the bridge-countries to permit them to hold in their lagers those who aspire to a better life for themselves and their children. Rather policy solutions should be searched for that push the governments to solve the problems in the migrants' countries of origin, also coming to sustainable and correct co-development agreements. It is about redesigning all of the world's foreign policy, and not about ""helping them at home""! We need to offer complex solutions coordinated with other States that help everyone. In the perspective of a worldwide crisis affecting all humanity, not just the Italian or Greek coasts and our neighbours, I urge you to support this petition. LET 2018 BE THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF INTERNATIONAL MIGRANTS!"
5,Save Patients’ Rights,"Please voice your opinion and sign this petition if you believe the following:
“I believe every patient has the right to choose their trusted physician to guide their treatment plan during hospitalization. I request the NCH Hospital Board of Trustees to reconsider their admissions policy to ensure that community physicians can retain their admitting privileges”
 Under a new proposed policy at Naples Community Hospital (NCH) your Primary Care or Concierge medicine physician will not be able to admit you to the hospital if you need it, nor will he or she be able to write orders, choose consultants, or coordinate your discharge. Your existing medical care team that knows you best will be a “VISITOR”. The hospital system will re-assign you a new doctor. This new policy infringes on your fundamental right to choose who will direct your care while hospitalized.
In addition, NCH will eliminate current staff-privileged non-NCH employed hospitalist teams and replace them with their newly hired NCH employed hospitalists. Historically NCH has granted privileges to independent and community-based hospitalists alike that are working collaboratively with your Primary Care or Concierge Medicine doctor. Many current independent hospitalists have access to your medical records from the office in order to provide continuity of care while you are in the hospital. The forthcoming hired NCH hospitalists do not have access to these records. This model has been presented as an improvement so you can be treated quickly and discharged sooner based on a small “pilot” trial with a small number of patients. This was in part achieved by ramping up ancillary staff to work with the NCH hospitalists on the pilot floor only. The same ancillary support was withheld from the independent doctors/hospitalists (not employed by NCH) to be able to achieve equal or even better results.
Any consulted specialists will also be dictated by the NCH hospitalist, not your Primary Care team. NCH appears to be moving systematically towards a closed medical staff system. They have initially prohibited all non-employed primary care teams, concierge doctors and hospitalists from admitting patients to the “pilot” floor. Slowly this will be rolled out floor by floor until the goal of a closed system is completed.

Our government should be reducing energy demand and shifting to clean energy, but instead it’s considering allowing the UK’s biggest coal plant to turn into the country’s biggest gas plant - and to pump our atmosphere full of dirty emissions for decades to come.

The Drax biomass and coal plant in Yorkshire where I live is currently the country’s largest CO2 producer (1). The government is stopping coal production by 2025, but rather than shut down altogether, Drax is trying to simply switch to burning a different fossil fuel - gas. Drax itself admits that these plans will increase greenhouse gas emissions. Locking the country into burning more fossil fuels for decades is not the way to meet urgent climate targets.

As if that wasn’t bad enough - Drax is asking the government for millions of pounds of public money to do it (2). These subsidies are in addition to the £2 million per day it already receives from the government for burning millions of tonnes of wood, over half of which comes from carbon-rich, biodiverse forests in the southern US which are being destroyed and turned into wood pellets (3). These vast subsidies keep Drax burning and polluting. They should end and it should close.

81 British and international environmental organisations have already written an open letter to the government calling for the planning permission to be denied and urging that no public money is pumped into this development. It’s incredibly important that this is backed up by people like you and me. That’s why I’m urgently asking you to sign my petition to stop this development, and protect our environment - before it’s too late.

Please sign to stop Drax building the UK’s biggest gas plant and damaging our climate for decades to come

Public housing in these suburbs are largely composed of lower socioeconomic immigrant communities. Many of whom have immigrated from Africa have continuously faced documented anti-Black discrimination at the hands of the police. You have previously acknowledged the racism and disregard police have in the so-called Australia for Indigenous communities. We know that this racism affects all People of Colour, but especially towards Black immigrants as well. To send cops into their housing is to completely disregard their safety and their mental health when considering the trauma associated with past experiences at the hands of the police.

In not allowing anyone to leave public housing for any reason. You have disproportionately infringed on their rights. All other lockdown suburbs are able to leave the house for work, study, groceries and exercise, despite these other areas having significant active cases. To deny these people the same right is discriminatory. We saw those with the privilege to travel being isolated in nice hotels with security - not cops. I ask exactly why you have chosen cops? Is it not to instill fear and coerce cooperation among these communities?

If you truly cared about Victorians, you would have locked down all of metropolitan Melbourne much earlier. It is clear by the way you have gone about this that you have prioritised economic growth at the cost of working class and migrant communities. This decision is not only discriminatory but may also be very dangerous.

PLEASE REMOVE THESE POLICE FROM PUBLIC HOUSING EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY."
13,Set Consistent Punishment Guidelines for NFL Players Who Commit Violence Against Women,"Ray Rice, a running back for the NFL's Baltimore Ravens, was just issued a 2 game suspension for hitting his partner in the face so hard he knocked her unconscious.
This is just the most recent example of the NFL’s persistent and serious problem with players committing violence against women. Of 32 teams, 21 have players that have been charged at some point with domestic or sexual violence.
What’s even more appalling is how the NFL chooses to punish players who commit these crimes. While Rice sits out of the first two games of the 2014 season his teammate, Will Hill, will be suspended for six games for marijuana use. In fact, the NFL consistently hands down stricter punishments for breaking the substance abuse policy than for committing violent crimes against female partners and acquaintances. 
Comissioner Roger Goodell has acknowledged the NFL has a domestic violence problem and said it’s the responsibility of the NFL “to do some things to combat this problem.” One thing the NFL must do is establish consistent, mandatory disciplinary procedures for violations of the league’s ‘personal conduct policy’ similar to the mandatory minimum 4 game suspension players face if they violate the substance abuse policy. 
When the NFL doesn’t take domestic violence seriously the league is sending a message to its players, its team owners, and its fans they shouldn’t either. The NFL is telling women, one in four of which will be a victim of domestic violence, that what happens to them, to quote Ravens head coach John Harbaugh when asked about Rice’s actions, is “not that big of a deal.”
If the NFL doesn't start taking violence against women seriously now, when will it ever? It’s time to hold the NFL accountable for what it does, not what its Commissioner and others say it will do.

New Zealand's hospitality industry is heavily reliant on overseas staff due to a consistent shortfall of locally qualified, dedicated and professional employees.

As a country that's renowned for its tourism, contributing $65.2 million a day into the economy, with hospitality being a vital part of that, isn't it time we realized how vital it is that we need to meet the demand for professional staff through changing the current immigration laws?

We are recognized worldwide as an incredible tourist destination and need to ensure the hospitality sector has the best staff to deliver the highest level of products and services.

As of late the immigration laws have become even more restrictive and prevent employers from retaining their best overseas staff, and these employees from committing to their place of work for an extended period of time, further extensively contributing through their international experience and knowledge within the sector.

The aim of this petition is to make the immigration department recognize the enormous contribution these people make to the hospitality industry in this country.

We need to show how dependent businesses are on such staff, and enable employers to sponsor the right staff to ensure sustainability,stability, consistency and professionalism within this growing and important industry through increasing the length of the work visas, as long as the staff remain with their employer, or within the industry.

A partire dal 1 giugno, giorno in cui la sentenza sulla demolizione del villaggio beduino palestinese di Khan al Ahmar è divenuta esecutiva, i bimbi e le famiglie si trovano in una situazione di terribile stress e tensione. Ogni mattina potrebbe accadere l’irrevocabile. Il Governo Israeliano, infatti, potrebbe in qualsiasi momento ordinare di radere al suolo il villaggio abitato da circa 180 persone da oltre 60 anni. In questo luogo ha sede una piccola scuola che è diventata simbolo del diritto all’istruzione e della difesa dei diritti delle comunità beduine residenti nell’Area C della Palestina controllata da Israele.

In qualsiasi momento la scuola potrebbe essere distrutta. Per favore firma la petizione!

Si tratta della “Scuola di Gomme”, così chiamata perché realizzata su pneumatici usati, per fare fronte al divieto delle Autorità Israeliane di realizzare costruzioni in muratura nell'Area C. La scuola è stata realizzata da Vento di Terra e da altre Ong, ma non si tratta di una semplice costruzione: in quel luogo risiedono le speranze di un futuro migliore, di un futuro di pace, per oltre 170 bambini del villaggio e delle zone limitrofe. Minori che a causa delle limitazioni imposte dai militari e dell’isolamento dei villaggi dove risiedono non hanno alternative reali e rischiano di perdere il diritto all’istruzione primaria.

La demolizione della scuola di Khan Al Ahmar creerebbe un pericoloso precedente e un grave danno alla comunità locale, ponendo le basi per una sua rapida deportazione.

Mi chiamo Angela Celeste Costantino, sono una decoratrice e una viaggiatrice. Una parte delle mie opere d’arte ha un’impronta dedicata al sociale, alla difesa dei diritti delle donne, dei bambini, dei popoli in territori di guerra e di terrorismo. Ho scelto di creare questa petizione, sostenendo con tutta me stessa questa causa, perché credo che ogni scuola, in qualsiasi territorio del mondo debba rappresentare un luogo di crescita e insieme un luogo di dialogo e di pace. Ogni bambino sulla terra ha diritto ad essere istruito, ad avere i mezzi per sviluppare le proprie potenzialità, ad apprendere la cultura e le nozioni per gettare le basi per un futuro migliore.

Non è giusto. E’ crudele, è disumano rendere vittime i più deboli. La mia rabbia, il mio sdegno, nascono da qui: tagliare loro la libertà di crescere studiando e imparando, per diventare uomini e donne migliori. La cultura è l’unica arma, la più potente, che può rappresentare un mezzo di riscatto e di crescita per tutti. Se si distrugge una scuola, si distrugge la libertà, la cultura, la vita stessa, il futuro.

Facciamo sì che non vengano calpestati i diritti alla vita, alla libertà, all'istruzione, di piccoli innocenti la cui scuola rappresenta l'unico mezzo di riscatto, di cultura, di apprendimento, di socialità, per costruire un futuro migliore. Un appello: ognuno con i propri mezzi possibili, aiutiamoli!

Nós, profissionais do Direito Ambiental, vimos externar nossa extrema preocupação com as recentes queimadas que têm atingido o Pantanal e a Amazônia brasileira. A grave seca que assola a região, certamente, não é a principal causa dos inúmeros incêndios florestais, como já levantado pela Polícia Federal. Não se negue, a omissão e o incentivo, algumas vezes velado, outras tantas explícito para o desmatamento e a conversão de áreas para o pastoreio ilegal.

O Ministério do Meio Ambiente, flagrantemente, abandonou a sua função constitucional de defesa de nosso patrimônio ambiental, tendo se transformado em polo de defesa dos setores mais atrasados e predatórios da economia nacional. Lamentamos que o MMA tenha negligenciado o seu importante papel de coordenação entre os Estados e os Municípios, como forma de combater catástrofe tão relevante.

Os inúmeros esforços que o País vem fazendo, desde 1981, têm sido malbarateados por uma administração que, claramente, objetiva destruir o nosso arcabouço legal tão arduamente construído. O desrespeito à Constituição Federal, em especial ao artigo 225, transformou-se em rotina manejada por piromaníacos.

O País, sede de duas grandes conferências internacionais sobre meio ambiente, se transforma em um pária da comunidade internacional.

Manifestamos nosso absoluto repúdio às atuais políticas anti-ambientais e conclamamos a sociedade e as Instituições para que cobrem, inclusive judicialmente, que as autoridades, em nível federal e estadual, assumam o seu dever constitucional de proteção do meio ambiente e da Amazônia e do Pantanal, que são patrimônios nacionais insculpidos em nossa Lei Fundamental.



DECLARATION OF REPUDIATION: BURNS IN THE PANTANAL AND AMAZON

We, lawyers and professionals in the field of Environmental Law, are here to express our strong concern with the recent wildfires that are destroying Pantanal and the Brazilian Amazon. The Brazilian Federal Police have already announced that the main cause of the wildfires is not the severe drought plaguing the region, but rather efforts to deforest the areas. It is impossible to deny the federal government’s lack of response and even its incentive, both veiled and explicit, for deforestation and the conversion of areas for illegal grazing.

The Ministry of the Environment (MMA) flagrantly abandoned its constitutional function of defending our environmental heritage and has become a center for the defense of the most backward and predatory sectors of the national economy. We regret that MMA has neglected its important coordination role between States and Municipalities, as a way to combat such a devastating catastrophe.

The countless efforts that Brazil has been taking since 1981 are now being undermined by an administration that clearly aims to destroy our legal framework for environment protection that professionals in our field have worked so hard to build. Disrespect for the Federal Constitution, especially Article 225, has become a routine managed by pyromaniacs.

The country, home to two major international conferences on the environment, has become an outcast in the international community.

We express our absolute rejection of the current anti-environmental policies and we call on society and the Institutions to demand, even judicially, that the authorities, at the federal and state level, assume their constitutional duty to protect the environment, the Amazon, and the Pantanal, which are national assets protected by our Fundamental Law."

Nas últimas semanas multiplicam-se os casos de desaparecimento, morte e violência sexual contra as mulheres chilenas.

Em situações de conflito, o estupro e o feminicídio são ardilosamente empregados para o exercício do terror político, sendo utilizados como modo de fomentar pânico e instaurar a supremacia de grupos políticos, podendo ser respaldado pelas lideranças políticas oficiais, como forma de repressão e humilhação. “O estupro tem relação direta com todas as estruturas de poder existentes em determinadas sociedades (DAVIS, 2017: 49) (1).  O estupro, também nesses casos, é uma punição e o estuprador, um moralizador, em seu próprio entendimento (2).

Não há dúvidas de que a polícia deste país está usando da força para violentar sexualmente e assassinar as mulheres chilenas. Isso está evidente nos casos de Daniela Carrasco, manifestante que foi assassinada, violentada e deixada em uma praça pública para “servir de exemplo” às outras mulheres. Também é o caso em que um grupo de policiais foram flagrados deixando violentamente uma mulher seminua durante um ato de manifestação. Esses e outros casos violam, pelo menos, o Artigo V da Declaração Universal de Direitos Humanos da ONU, o qual diz: “ninguém será submetido à tortura nem a tratamento ou castigo cruel, desumano ou degradante.” (3). A situação também viola a resolução 1960 (2010) do Conselho de Segurança da ONU sobre Mulheres, Paz e Segurança (4), a qual reitera, em tradução livre, a necessidade de todos os Estados e partes não-estatais em conflitos cumprirem totalmente suas obrigações sob a lei internacional aplicável, incluindo a proibição de todas as formas de violência sexual.

Por isso, solicitamos à ONU Mulheres e ao  Alto Comissariado das Nações Unidas para Direitos Humanos que investiguem e intervenham nos casos de violência sexual e feminicídio  das mulheres chilenas como forma de repressão às manifestações contra o governo de Sabastián Piñera.

Stop raping and murdering Chilean women!

Since October Chilean protesters have been facing strong repression by the government of Sebastián Piñera. In the last weeks, cases of disappearance, death and sexual violence against Chilean women have multiplied.

In conflict situations, rape and feminicide are cunningly used to create political terror. They are also a way of fomenting panic in order to establish the supremacy of political groups, and it may be supported by official political leaders to repress and humiliate. “Rape is directly related to all existing power structures in particular societies” (DAVIS, 2017: 49) (1). Also in these cases, rape is a punishment and the rapist, a moralizer, in his own understanding (2).

There is no doubt that the Chilean Police are using force to sexually assault and kill the Chilean women. It is evident based on cases as the murder of Daniela Carrasco. She was a protester who was raped, killed and left in a public square to “set an example” to other women. This violence is also the case that happened with a group of policemen caught violently leaving a woman half-naked during an act of demonstration. These cases violate the Article V of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” (3). The situation also violates the UN Security Council resolution 1960 (2010) on Women, Peace and Security (4), which reiterates the obligation of all states and non-states in conflict to fully comply with their obligations under applicable international law, including the prohibition of all forms of sexual violence.

We therefore request the UN Women and the UN High Commissioner for human rights to investigate and intervene in cases of sexual violence and feminicide against Chilean women to repress their protests against the government of Sebastián Piñera.

Climate change threatens our social, economic and environmental stability. While recognizing that the municipality does have structures and programs in place to address areas of climate change, it needs to be recognized that climate change models are being reviewed constantly, and that across the board are becoming increasingly pessimistic in their outlooks. It is recognized that all previous models have underestimated, and continue to underestimate, the accumulative effects of global warming.

We have already experienced some effects of climate change in Toronto to a small degree. These effects as well as new threats will increase at an accelerating rate within the next five to ten years, until they far surpass the scale which most people currently envisage. Threats that Toronto faces include:

The time for radical change is now. Action to address the multi faceted threats that face our City, Country and the International Community need to be accelerated.

In addition, Toronto needs to add its voice to other municipalities across the world in demanding that World leaders act in meaningful ways immediately to combat this grave global threat. We do less than is necessary at our own peril."

#ŞehirHepimizin İnisiyatifi kimdir?

#ŞehirHepimizin İnisiyatifi, Halkbank tarafından haksız bir süreçle İstanbul Şehir Üniversitesi'nin bütün banka hesaplarına ihtiyati haciz uygulanması üzerine farklı kesimlerden bir araya gelmiş bir öğrenci grubudur. İnisiyatif'in amacı, bu süreç içerisinde gelişen hukuksuzlukların ve sonuçlarının duyurularak bu durumun doğru şekilde çözülmesini sağlayabilmektir.

İstanbul Şehir Üniversitesi kimdir?

Durum ne?

Türkiye’de ilk defa bir eğitim kurumuna ihtiyati haciz getirildi ve süreç boyunca hukuksuzluklar göz ardı edildi. Başta dünyanın her yerinden gelen ve hayalleri olan öğrenciler olmak üzere, buraya emek vermiş binlerce insanın hayatı bu belirsizlik yüzünden altüst oldu.

Nasıl ortaya çıktı?

14 Ekim 2019 tarihinde ŞEHİR, kamuoyuna Halkbank’ın bütün banka hesaplarına ihtiyati haciz koydurduğunu ve hiçbir mal varlığına ulaşamadığını açıklamıştır.

Ne var ki bu durum yeni ortaya çıkmamıştı ve altında çeşitli motifler yatıyordu:

- ŞEHİR’e tahsis edilen arazi üzerine tahsisin kaldırılması için birkaç farklı kurum tarafından 15 dava açılmış ve Üniversite ancak bu davaların hepsi  lehine sonlandıktan sonra Dragos Kampüsteki çalışmalarını başlatmıştır.

- ŞEHİR, araziyi teminat göstererek Kampüsü yapılandırmak için Halkbank’tan yatırım kredisi almaya başlamıştır.

- Davalarda son karar verildikten sonra, dava açma süresi zaman aşımına girmiş olmasına rağmen arazi devrinin iptal edilmesi için TMMOB tarafından 16. bir dava açılabilmiştir(!).

- Halkbank, bu hukuken usulsüzce açılan davayı elindeki teminatın değerinin düştüğünü bahane ederek anlaşmalarını teker teker bozmaya başlamıştır:



Üniversitenin hiçbir banka hesabına ulaşamaması demek:

Böylece, yavaş yavaş rutin fonksiyonlarını sağlayamayarak finansal olarak batmaya sürüklenmesi, yani:



Sen de bu haksızlık ve hukuksuzluğa hayır de; sesimize ortak ol, ortak et!

Neden ortaya çıktığı belli olmayan bir durumdan ötürü öğrenciler sağlıklı bir şekilde doğru dürüst ders çalışamaz hale getirildi.

Türkiye’de hukukun ve eğitim ahlakının yok olmasına izin vermeyelim!

__________ ENGLISH VERSION:

About #SehirHepimizin Initiative:

#SehirHepimizin Initiative is a group of students from different walks of life who united due to placing a precautionary lien on all bank accounts of Istanbul Sehir University immorally and unlawfully. Its aim is to inform the public and to change the direction of the issue while hoping to provide a solution as soon as possible.

About Istanbul Sehir University:



What's the issue?

For the first time, a precautionary lien is brought to an educational institution in Turkey. In addition, unlawful acts were constantly ignored throughout the process. Over 5 weeks, especially of the students from all over the world, lives of thousands are ruined by this uncertainty.

How did it emerge?

On 14 October 2019, SEHIR officially announced to the public that Halkbank had placed a precautionary lien on all of its bank accounts and that it cannot access any of its assets.

However, this situation had a long-going background and several motives underneath:

- As a start, there were 15 lawsuits filed by several different organizations for the abolition of the allocation on the land allocated to SEHIR, and the University only started the construction on the land on Dragos Campus only after all of these cases were concluded in its favor.

- SEHIR started to receive investment loans from Halkbank in order to build up the Campus by showing the land allocated as collateral.

- After the final ruling was given in all lawsuits, a 16th lawsuit was opened by TMMOB to cancel the transfer of the land, although the lapse of time for filing the lawsuit was exceeded.

- Halkbank began to break their agreements made with the university one by one under the pretext that the latest unlawfully and improperly filed lawsuit decreased the value of SEHIR’s collateral:

A university having no access to any of its bank accounts means:

Giving way to these attempts of financially failing this university results in:



Say no to this injustice and unlawfulness, and be a part of our voice!

Students have not been able to healthily focus on their studies due to a complication created God knows why.

Don't let the destruction of law and education morals in Turkey!

The Government needs to do much, much more. That means helping to make electric vehicles affordable for everyone and putting in place a national charging network so that drivers across the UK are confident of life with an Electric Vehicle. I have started the FairCharge campaign to make sure this happens.

Greater uptake of the latest, long-range Electric Vehicles will help us improve air quality, give greater energy security, lower our fuel costs and reduce climate change. Electric cars and vans are the beginning of the process of transitioning from polluting fossil fuels to renewable energy - a once in a generation opportunity to stop burning hydrocarbons.

Yet some recent policy decisions have done nothing to help expand EV use beyond the wealthy. This simply isn’t fair. If we are going to increase EV uptake, then we need to have far-sighted, fair government policies that make EVs appealing to everyone.

Amongst other things, we need the Government to make sure that:

This week, Carriageworks was unable to secure its regular funding from the NSW Government and as a result has had to go into voluntary administration.

We cannot let this be the end. We cannot let Carriageworks be the ‘canary in the mine’ for Australia’s devastated artistic and cultural landscape. Glady Berejiklian as the acting arts minister and NSW premier needs to offer comprehensive support to the arts community during the coronavirus shutdown, starting with providing Carriageworks with some financial security.

Carriageworks means a great deal to artists and audiences. Losing it due to the coronavirus shutdown would be a devastating blow to the arts ecology, not to mention Sydney's already vulnerable cultural scene.

We do not want Carriageworks to disappear, be taken over by larger companies and corporations, or be made to surrender it’s curatorial self determination.

We want a creative and cultural Arts Stimulus Package to be introduced by the NSW government to save this iconic building, and have it re-open stronger and more uniquely ‘Carriageworks’ than ever.

Let’s combine our voices to put pressure on the NSW Government to step in and save Carriageworks.I am ask anyone who sees this petition to contact Gladys Berejiklian and demand the NSW Government step in:

...and we ask that you copy+paste this and post it alongside a photo of your favourite memory from Carriageworks.

In uniting to save Carriageworks, we are fighting for the broader arts sector and the community that values it. With your help, we can save the arts. We can #SaveCarriageworks

Pleas sign this petition and help me save Carriageworks!

23,Migliorare la qualità dell'ambiente di Modena,esperienza in Climate Alliance con una connessione della strada di passeggio tra due piazze e due grandi,"['Petizione diretta a Gian Carlo Muzzarelli', 'Alessandra Filippi', 'Consiglieri Comunali']",Giovani Democratici Provincia di Modena,"Modena, Italia",256,Data di lancio 18 giu 2018,https://assets.change.org/photos/8/td/bc/fjtDbcMPHJmxYcH-800x450-noPad.jpg?1529337600,"Modena Green

All’attenzione del sindaco Gian Carlo Muzzarelli, dell’assessore A. Filippi e del consiglio comunale di Modena, i Giovani Democratici della città, il Movimento Giovanile della Sinistra e il sindacato studentesco Unione Universitaria con il seguente documento, illustrano “Modena Green” un progetto basato su tre punti per migliorare Modena dal punto di vista dell’ambiente in modo concreto e sensibilizzare la cittadinanza tutta verso un cambiamento ecologico e di salvaguardia del pianeta.

Modena Old Diesel Free

Come prima analisi si propone lo stop totale dei veicoli super inquinanti su territorio comunale. Questo provvedimento tende ad andare oltre al PAIR (Piano Aria Integrato Regionale), sia nei mesi di applicazione sia nei veicoli inquinanti sottoposti a manovra. E’ stata immaginata una “scala mobile” rispetto alle suddivisioni PAIR del 2020 con due classi sotto al diesel e uno alla benzina. La manovra attuale prevede: (0,1,2,3 diesel e 0,1 benzina, quindi 0-1 diesel/0 benzina). La manovra 2018-2020 prevedrebbe: (0,1,2,3,4 diesel e 0,1,2 benzina, quindi 0-1-2 diesel/0-1 benzina). Questo schema verrebbe poi ripetuto adattandosi ai nuovi provvedimenti oltre il 2020.

PAIR

Ottobre - Marzo                                              Marzo - Ottobre                                                     Attuale

Diesel 0-1-2-3 | Benzina 0-1               Diesel 0-1 | Benzina 0                                                  2018-2020

Diesel 0-1-2-3-4 | Benzina 0-1-2         Diesel 0-1-2 | Benzina 0-1

Questo provvedimento permette al comune di anticipare la Regione, rientrare dentro al PAIR e non ha nessun costo per l’amministrazione. Ovviamente il Comune dovrebbe richiedere alla Regione impegni concreti sugli eco-incentivi, per cambio veicoli a metano/ibridi e per acquisto bici a pedalata assistita, al fine di incentivare il ricambio di vecchie automobili e aiutare le frange meno abbienti della popolazione. Si ricorda inoltre che si potrebbero attivare sconti vantaggiosi sui parcheggi a strisce blu per chi possiede un'auto ibrida e gratuità per le elettriche o  a parcheggi dedicati (“strisce verdi”), si segnalano ad esempio i casi di Bologna e Parma.

Domeniche Ecologiche XXL

In seconda analisi si suggerisce di convertire in XXL le attuali domeniche ecologiche. Infatti secondo l’attuale PAIR si impone una domenica ecologica ogni prima settimana del mese nel periodo ottobre-marzo, spesso escludendo gennaio. Il comune in queste domeniche, anche in questo caso, potrebbe anticipare il PAIR 2020 e bloccare i diesel 4 e i benzina 2. (Si rammenta che le domeniche ecologiche sono differenti dalle domeniche senz'auto e quindi il blocco del traffico). Si ricorda inoltre che Il Comune di Modena ha già sperimentato ciò a settembre 2017, convertendo la Domenica Senz’Auto, ma con un’area di applicazione più piccola. Questo provvedimento porta dei vantaggi dal punto di vista ambientale, Modena andrebbe oltre il PAIR; non prevede costi aggiuntivi poiché per le domeniche ecologiche sono già previste dalle attività del Settore Ambiente. Infine si anticipa ai cittadini quale sarà la situazione tra 3 anni. Si fa notare che sarebbe necessario un rinforzo dei trasporti pubblici in occasione delle domeniche ecologiche con un aumento delle corse .

Isola Pedonale In Centro Storico

Infine si consiglia di creare un’isola pedonale in centro storico nei giorni festivi e/o weekend. Prendendo spunto dalla realtà consolidata dei T-Days di Bologna, bisogna ovviamente riadattare a Modena questa idea per ovvie ragioni di dimensione del centro storico e per la diversa conformazione della  Ztl modenese. Si sottolinea che  occorre garantire al solo trasporto pubblico il passaggio attraverso via Emilia o per vie alternative in modo che  il centro storico rimanga collegato con il resto della città. Per questo punto si illustrano due esempi stranieri a supporto di questa idea: in primis il comune di Rennes (211mila abitanti) ha portato una sua esperienza in Climate Alliance con una connessione della strada di passeggio tra due piazze e due grandi parcheggi custoditi e “allestiti” tutte le volte. In secundis la municipalità di Bruxelles ha legato la pedonalizzazione al tema sicurezza dopo gli attentati terroristici con un progetto mostrato al board Energy Cities.

Di seguito viene proposta la cartina con le aeree da pedonalizzare:

https://i.imgur.com/zqY199k.jpg

Conclusioni:

L’obbiettivo di Modena Green è quello di iniziare quei processi di cambiamento finalizzati ad un miglioramento della qualità dell’aria del nostro territorio. La sfida che ci troviamo davanti come cittadini non è da delegare solo all’amministrazione ma bisogna coinvolgere tutti gli attori partendo dal cittadino, passando alle aziende e arrivando alle istituzioni. Modena Green è il punto di partenza, non il punto di arrivo, per migliorare la qualità dell’aria del nostro territorio. Il sistema di trasporto andrà nel tempo modificato come ci indica il PAIR, favorendo sempre di più l’utilizzo di trasporti meno inquinanti e i trasporti collettivi. La cittadinanza andrà sempre di più sensibilizzata in modo pragmatico: zona pedonale nel centro storico, spettro più ampio dell’autovetture super inquinanti che non possono circolare ed infine ecoincentivi da parte della regione per poter aiutare i cittadini a sostituire la propria automobile che altrimenti non potrebbero circolare."
24,Privacy Matters,"the biggest issues surrounding boys restrooms; at Elsik High School is the lack of privacy. Currently” says Jerry Rivera, a student attending Elsik. Privacy is important, it doesn't matter who you are. We all need privacy in our lives. More importantly, we specifically need privacy within the bathrooms of our schools. When we don't have privacy in our bathrooms, students are exposed to many risks. Students describe that the lack of privacy provides them with the feeling of humiliation. But this","['Students of Elsik high School', 'aliefisd', 'Ms.Elzy']",Darius The Greatest,"Houston, TX, United States",31,"Feb 1, 2019",https://assets.change.org/photos/0/yu/ul/myyUulsmUJHUxdo-800x450-noPad.jpg?1549683650,"For years now, schools have been built with the idea that we as students would be productive and work efficient. Although at times this thought comes to fruition, its difficult to believe that the place where our students handle the most business is simply unappealing, due to the unhygienic and messy aura of our bathrooms. Bathrooms have been an ongoing issue for millenia. Although many schools believe their bathrooms are satisfactory in the context of sanitation, the majority of students disagree and believe our restrooms are not only unhealthy and unsanitary, but also disorderly. We believe this needs to change. It’s time we improve our area of business, it's time we improve our bathrooms.

Although there are seemingly countless problems with public bathrooms in general, one of the biggest issues surrounding boys restrooms; at Elsik High School is the lack of privacy. Currently on main campus, there are a total of 26 boys restrooms throughout the building, however out of these 26 bathrooms, 13 do not have stalls separating the toilets or urinals.  “It makes me uncomfortable” says Jerry Rivera, a student attending Elsik. Privacy is important, it doesn't matter who you are. We all need privacy in our lives. More importantly, we specifically need privacy within the bathrooms of our schools. When we don't have privacy in our bathrooms, students are exposed to many risks. Students describe that the lack of privacy provides them with the feeling of humiliation. But this isn't the only issue with bathrooms in our schools.

If our bathrooms went to the doctor for their yearly check up, they would be told numerous wrongs, like “You’re too messy” or “Have you been showering daily?” Unfortunately for us students, we must bear the smell of our own business within our bathroom walls, whilst also dealing with other sanitary issues. Sanitation is a key component to the lives of children, it not only affects how we feel, but also how we learn. In the words of Lauren Newman, a journalist for EagleEye News, some of these sanitary hazards include lack of ventilation, toilet paper, soap and sometimes even urine and toilet water on the floor. Furthermore, a study conducted by Ms. Newman found that 67% of students purposely avoid using school bathrooms and would rather wait till they got home. This simply means that bathrooms are far too unsanitary for students to use. Okay, so we know that bathrooms are unhealthy, but the question is how? Bathrooms vary from toilet to toilet, in our school it's quite common to find toilet paper or paper towels all over the bathroom floor. Furthermore, arguably the most unhygienic factor of our bathrooms are our toilets. The toilets are almost always covered with urine, incentivising students to just hold it in. Not only that, but the “0” shape of the toilets increase the risk of backsplash when sitting down, and increases the chances of your privates resting where someone elses privates have been. Lets face it; bathrooms are pretty disgusting, however there is a solution to this “messy” situation.

Whether it’s paper towels on the floor or urine on the toilet seats, there is a solution to virtually all these problems. In an article published by Simon Lockrey, a professor from RMIT University, Lockrey describes hand dryers as not only much more sanitary, but also better for the environment. In fact, hand dryers have proven to be up to 126% more sanitary contrary to paper towels, making air drying the far more beneficial alternative. One of the more obvious advantages of air drying is its aid to the environment. When we use hand dryers, it eliminates the need for paper towels, making paper towels a thing of the past. However let’s not forget about the unhygienic aura of our toilets. The question you’re probably asking right now is “how can toilets be accounted for?” and although it seems complicated, the answer is a lot more clear than it seems. Now that we’ve recognized that the “0” shape in toilet lids cause numerous problems, the more sanitary alternative would be a “U” shape. The “U” shape eliminates the problems we previously encountered such as backsplash and putting your privates where someone else’s has been.

At the end of the day, bathrooms are still bathrooms, they’ll always be just a tad bit unsanitary, but recently we’ve seen this problem expand until it’s practically become a crisis. Today we advocate to stop this, and we advocate for more funding towards our bathrooms.

25,Boris Johnson: Apologise for comparing Muslim women to letterboxes,"in a newspaper last year about Muslim women - comparing us to “letterboxes” and “bankrobbers attempted to justify his positions by claiming he was defending the rights of Muslim women to wear what they want. It didn’t defend us Muslim women at all. Instead, it used careless and mocking language on a national platform. It’s the same racist language that Muslim women are subjected to on the normalise attacks - making Muslim women unsafe. 
So here is what I have to say to Boris Johnson. I know",['Boris Johnson'],Aisha Ali-Khan,"Keighley, ENG, United Kingdom",39305,"Sep 5, 2019",https://assets.change.org/photos/0/re/us/WqReUsuzTXdNcyf-800x450-noPad.jpg?1567684347,"13 months later, our Prime Minister Boris Johnson still hasn’t apologised for comments he had wrote in a newspaper last year about Muslim women - comparing us to “letterboxes” and “bankrobbers”.  It’s been reported that following his article, reported abuse against Muslims rose by 375%.In the House of Commons yesterday Johnson was again asked to apologise, with MP Tanmanjeet Singh demanding that Johnson take responsibility & address the impact of his words. Johnson refused, and instead attempted to justify his positions by claiming he was defending the rights of Muslim women to wear what they want. It didn’t defend us Muslim women at all. Instead, it used careless and mocking language on a national platform. It’s the same racist language that Muslim women are subjected to on the streets. That’s why I’m calling on Boris Johnson to apologise. Please help by signing.

I have close friends who have been attacked in the street. And my mother wore the burka nearly all her life. She felt safe and protected while wearing it. But our Prime Minister’s comments equip the far right to normalise attacks - making Muslim women unsafe.

So here is what I have to say to Boris Johnson. I know that you have supported issues that have affected Muslim women in the past, such as the fight against FGM and that your current cabinet is indeed the most diverse in history. But seriously, it is high time you apologised. Not only to my fellow Muslim sisters who have been directly affected by your careless comments but also to the electorate.

We deserve a PM who listens, and can accept when he has made a mistake.

By digging in your heels, you are only making yourself look stubborn, out of touch & arrogant. And the true victims of your stance will continue to be Muslim women who are already amongst the most marginalised and stigmatised of BAME groups."

27,Justice pour les Tamouls,"Nous, Tamouls issus de la diaspora, sommes très inquiets de ce qui se passe de jour en jour au Sri Lanka. Par exemple, la nuit du 8 janvier 2021, les autorités sri-lankaises se sont faufilées dans l'Université de Jaffna et ont utilisé un bulldozer pour détruire complètement une statue commémorative de guerre réalisée par les Tamouls du Sri Lanka.
Pourquoi cette statue compte-t-elle beaucoup pour les Tamouls ?
Pendant les dernières années de la guerre civile opposant le gouvernement sri-lankais et les Tigres de Libération de l'Eelam Tamoul, plus de 40 000 civils innocents capturés à Mullivaikal ont été brutalement abattus: ils tentaient de fuir craignant pour leur vie.La statue détruite a été construite en hommage aux Tamouls ayant perdu leur vie pendant cette période.
Un autre exemple, bien plus récent : les terres d'un ancien temple hindou ont été envahies par le Département d'Archéologie sri-lankais au mois de janvier 2021. Accompagnés de l'armée sri-lankaise, ces agents ont pénétré la région de Kurunthur (Mullaitheevu) et, après avoir procédé à l’enlèvement d’une sculpture liée au culte hindou, ils y installèrent une statue de Bouddha.Encore une fois, notre histoire et notre culture sont bafouées et la voix des citoyens Tamouls vivant au Sri-Lanka est réduite au silence.
C’est pourquoi nous envoyons une lettre à l’intention de l’Organisation des Nations Unies et ses états membres. 
À l’intention de l'Organisation des Nations Unies et ses états membres
Objet : 46ème session du CDH et la nouvelle résolution sur le Sri Lanka
Nous soussignés, qui incluons des représentants de la communauté tamoule ainsi que d’autres organisations et citoyens intéressés, parlons au nom des Tamouls d’Eelam contre lesquels l’État sri lankais, des acteurs parrainés par l’État, et les forces de sécurité ont commis de multiples actes de génocide de l’indépendance du Sri Lanka jusqu’à nos jours. Le Sri Lanka a commis les actes de génocide les plus odieux du XXIe siècle dans la phase finale de la guerre en 2008 et 2009.
Nous appelons les Nations Unies et leurs états membres à :
1. Adopter fermement et sans équivoque une résolution limitée dans le temps à la 46ème session du Conseil des Droits de l'Homme des Nations Unies prescrivant une enquête internationale, impartiale et indépendante sur la conduite de l'état sri-lankais et de son armée d'occupation pendant la phase finale de la guerre, et dans les actes de génocide et la violation des droits de l'homme en cours.
2. Adopter au Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies et/ou à l’Assemblée générale une résolution semblable à la résolution ci-dessus, mais renvoyant en outre le Sri Lanka devant la Cour pénale internationale (CPI).
3. Agir rapidement pour punir sévèrement les personnes reconnues responsables d'actes de génocide ou d'autres abus, et mettre en place un mécanisme de protection qui empêchera nous l’espérons, la répétition d’actes de violence envers la communauté tamoule.
Nous faisons cette demande en notant que :
1. L’État sri lankais et ses forces de sécurité sont accusés d’avoir commis un génocide contre les Tamouls de l’Eelam et d’avoir commis des crimes contre l’humanité, des crimes de guerre et de nombreuses violations des droits de la personne contre les Tamouls de l’Eelam (voir ici) ;
2. Certaines des pires atrocités commises par le Sri Lanka, ont été commises en 2009, lorsque des dizaines de milliers de civils tamouls de l’Eelam ont été massacrés dans le cadre d’un génocide prémédité. Le Sri Lanka a délibérément sous-estimé la population civile tamoule dans la zone de guerre (en affirmant que 70 000 personnes y vivaient, au lieu des 429 000) avant de couper l’approvisionnement en nourriture et en médicaments. Par la suite, ils ont tenté de détruire la zone dans laquelle ces centaines de milliers de civils s'étaient réfugiés, bien que le gouvernement sri-lankais ait admis que seulement quelques centaines de combattants des LTTE y vivaient (voir ici);
3. 146 679 civils tamouls de l’Eelam sont toujours portés disparus après la dernière phase de la guerre, beaucoup ayant disparu après avoir été saisis par les forces de sécurité sri-lankaises (voir ici ou ici) ;
4. Près de 12 ans se sont écoulés depuis les actes de génocide susmentionnés, au cours desquels aucun progrès tangible n'a été réalisé en vue d'une enquête indépendante sur le comportement des forces de sécurité sri-lankaises, et le temps qui passe a aidé le Sri Lanka à dissimuler ses atrocités en détruisant les preuves ;
5. Au cours des 12 dernières années, les forces de sécurité sri-lankaises ont bénéficié d'une impunité totale et l'état sri-lankais a éludé toute responsabilité, créant un dangereux précédent pour de futurs actes de génocide non seulement au Sri Lanka mais aussi ailleurs ;
6. Les actes de génocide se poursuivent encore aujourd’hui, les Tamouls de l’Eelam étant la cible d’abus tels que le viol, les conditions de vie désastreuses (en particulier parmi les déplacés internes), l’ethnocide et le nettoyage ethnique systématique des Tamouls de leurs terres sévit encore ;
7. La motivation de type nazi pour le génocide (l’idéologie selon laquelle le peuple cinghalais est un « peuple élu » et donc supérieur, et le Sri Lanka est leur « terre promise » et les Tamouls Eelam seraient une menace), et un appareil d’état de soutien, pourrait déclencher d’autres actes de génocide contre les Tamouls de l’Eelam à tout moment ;
8. Toute enquête interne sur la conduite du Sri Lanka serait intrinsèquement compromise, car elle équivaudrait à ce que l’auteur d’un crime juge sa propre innocence ;
9. Il ne peut y avoir de paix ou de stabilité durable dans la région sans responsabilité et réparation pour les crimes de guerre susmentionnés contre les civils tamouls d'Eelam.

However, dishonest merchants and world leaders are trying their best to cover the truths that aren't secrets to us anymore. Large industries control our daily supplies, including the petroleum we use in cars and the food we consume every day. The pollutants they emit during their production process can both harm public health and damage the environment by contributing to global warming, ozone hole, and the greenhouse effect. This has caused permanent adjustments to Earth's geological, biological, and economic systems.

The purpose of this petition is to warn and notify those lawmakers to establish new laws to fight climate change. These laws should be strict and should be enforced by officers around the world. Setting emission goals, supporting pollution-free industry, and adopting a carbon tax are just some of the policies that are needed to decrease the rate of global warming.

Global leaders need to be aware before they take action because every move they make affects how long the Earth will survive. Maybe they think the economy is more important than the living environment, but let me ask you a question. How will the economy improve if climate change forces people to give up work?

Yanis, mon petit garçon âgé de 8 ans, est avec ma femme et mes deux petites filles au lac de Villeneuve de la Raho. Sur le chemin du retour, une voiture s'arrête pour les laisser passer, ils s'engagent sur le passage piéton… Yanis en tête, est bien engagé.

C'est là que le véhicule de la meurtrière fonce sur lui en accélérant de plus en plus alors qu'il avait presque terminé de traverser le passage piéton. Elle lui coupe la priorité, le tamponne. Le choc est d'une telle violence que Yanis tape le pare-brise et le projette 5 mètres plus loin.

La meurtrière décide de s'enfuir et n'hésite pas à écraser Yanis qui blessé par-terre, elle le traine ensuite sur 22 mètres sous le châssis… La violence est telle que ses clavicules, cotes et thorax cassent, les deux poumons ont explosés ainsi que ses deux cols du fémur coupés.

Elle l'écrase avec la roue arrière, s'enfuit laissant mon petit garçon par terre comme un vulgaire déchet! Elle sera finalement interpellé 600 mètres plus loin et ramené au poste de police pour être libéré 1h après avoir été auditionné."

This is wrong, this is causing many hundreds of thousands of people to resort to going into debt to get treatment, or even worse, resorting to removing teeth when they could of been saved, some even removing their own teeth at home. There needs to be a dentistry reform in England whereby more NHS slots are offered up for people who cannot afford the higher prices of private care.

Thank you!

Michigan House Bill 4515 and Senate Bill 284 will effectively ban the practice of conversion therapy with minors by mental health professionals.

Conversion therapy, also referred to as reparative therapy, is the practice of attempting to change an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity using professionally discredited practices that can cause great harm, especially among youth who are forced to receive such services by individual practitioners or camps.

There is no scientific evidence that conversion therapy is effective in changing one’s sexual orientation or gender identity, and rather research supports that it may cause both immediate and lifelong harm, including suicide. A recent study found a 3X likelihood of clinical depression and 5X likelihood of a suicide attempt among youth who had undergone conversion therapy.

All primary U.S. associations of mental health professionals publicly oppose the use of conversion therapy including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Counseling Association, and National Association of Social Workers; including those associations specific to providers of mental health care to minors, including American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Society of Adolescent Health and Medicine.

As of April 2019, 16 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have banned the use of conversion therapy for minors by mental health professionals, and Michigan has an opportunity to be the next state in the US to ban this harmful practice.

We, the undersigned, urge your support of Senate Bill 284 and House Bill 4515 which will ban the use of conversion therapy in the state of Michigan by licensed mental health professionals."

Uber, together with other ridesharing applications, is so new in the Philippines that it shakes the decades-old transport laws in the country. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, the government agency mandated to control and regulate public transport, has recently issued a suspension order against Uber, citing laws that apply only to PUVs (like jeepneys, taxicabs, and buses). There is a current debate if ridesharing platforms, like Uber, fall within the current definition of PUVs: something that only the Congress can define by updating our existing laws.

In the absence of such laws concerning ridesharing platforms, I urge the Department of Transportation and the LTFRB to lift the suspension order in the name of the riding public whom they both serve. If it is the safety and welfare of the public they have in mind in coming up with their decision, I urge them to listen to the commuters.

Uber is not perfect. Just like all human inventions, it has its own flaws. But Uber is the best we’ve got. As a commuter, I choose Uber. I don’t want that option taken away from me, from us.

I am Rana, a Disabled streamer on the platform: Twitch. Its been no mystery to us for a while now that Twitch lacks diversity, and to make that even worse, it also lacks ways to find streamers within a minority community. A main focus of my streams is to not only represent the Disabled community, but to also advocate, educate, and be a listening ear to people within the community. I know many others like myself too.There is absolutely no way for people to know this unless they read panels and/or hang out in these streams for a bit first, and I feel that is just not acceptible. We have tags for Mental Health, Closed Captions and LGBT; its about damn time we added a tag for us Disabled folks, and those who advocate for us, too. Inclusivity is so important, we have come so far but we still have so far to go; and we need staff at Twitch to do it.People watch Twitch from all walks of life, so many different cultures but also so many different levels of experience with Disability. Twitch is a platform that is not only used for gaming, art, or hanging out; its a place where people can learn in an amazing setting surrounded by such a diverse group of people, a place where people can find a community with people like them and maybe feel more confident in themselves and their situation. Its just such a shame that it all goes to waste due to the lack of a tag; a way to be found.

Cette fête tant attendue s'est transformée en un véritable cauchemar, laissant des participants et des organisateurs sous le choc et dans l’incompréhension la plus totale.

Les animaux ont été pris de vomissements, de spasmes et de convulsions mortelles après avoir ingéré des boulettes empoisonnées qui avaient été intentionnellement dispersées sur le site. En l’espace de dix minutes, il y a eu trois décès.

Tous les médias en parlent et pourtant, chaque jour en France, des chiens sont empoisonnés dans l’indifférence générale. Les victimes d’empoisonnement sont en recrudescence : mort aux rats, cyanure, produits phytosanitaires… tant de poisons utilisés pour éliminer atrocement les chiens.

Nous adressons toutes nos pensées à tous ces chiens morts dans une telle barbarie, une telle lâcheté, dans le silence et l'indifférence : chez des particuliers, dans des jardins, dans des refuges, dans des forêts, dans la rue...

Les chiens ne sont pas seulement tués, ils ont été délibérément empoisonnés. Des êtres vivants doués de sensibilité ont été soumis à une agonie insoutenable, victimes de la cruauté humaine. Ces actes ignobles ne peuvent pas rester impunis.

Nous demandons que justice soit faite. Ce ne sont pas ""juste des animaux"", ce sont des êtres vivants doués de sensibilité. Nous exigeons que les autorités prennent toutes les mesures nécessaires pour enquêter sur ces incidents bien trop nombreux chaque jour en France, et traduire les coupables en justice. Les chiens tués méritent que leur vie soit respectée, et leur mémoire doit être honorée en s'assurant que de tels actes de cruauté ne se reproduisent jamais.

Nous espérons que ce drame survenu pendant le canicross permettra au moins de sensibiliser les pouvoirs publics à ce fléau. Empoisonner un chien, c'est un meurtre. Il doit y avoir des poursuites, des enquêtes et des condamnations exemplaires.

Signez cette pétition pour faire entendre la voix de ces si nombreuses victimes de la barbarie humaine. Aux côtés de l’association AVA - Agir pour la Vie Animale, agissez pour que ces crimes ne restent pas impunis !

That’s enough to lift all the hungry people in the UK out of food poverty.

Globally, if food waste was a country, it would be the third top carbon emitter after USA and China.

I've started this petition as part of Stop the Rot campaign because I want to see an end to this stark injustice.

Consumers are currently asked to do the lion's share of tackling food waste, but many businesses waste more in a day than a consumer does in a year.

Someone pays for these mountains of wasted food – be it you, victims of climate change, the person who can’t afford to eat, or the supermarket’s suppliers.

Food is mainly wasted on farms and in factories, but hugely affected by retailer policy. Imagine spending all year growing potatoes, just to have them rejected for being the wrong shape or size. Or toiling to overproduce cauliflowers for fear of ever missing an order. One farmer had to plough 300,000 perfectly edible cabbages back into the field. These unjust practices need to be stopped. Hidden from view, the waste piles up and suppliers suffer in silence.

It’s time to call on UK supermarkets to tackle the food waste their policies cause in their supply chains.

Three quarters of the UK’s food is sold through Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys and Morrisons. With a strong movement pressuring them, we can make them act!

Join Stop the Rot's call for the major supermarkets to:

- regularly publish their in-store and supply chain's food waste data, including collaborating to measure food waste on farms by 2018 to enable targeted reduction.

- commit to ambitious targets to reduce their own stores' and their manufacturing suppliers’ food waste by 30% by 2025

""In August , 2017, Daniel Guerra and Rodrigo Dantas were hired by the Netherlands-based ""The Yacht Delivery Company"" recruiting agency to transport a 72-foot English flag sailboat from Salvador / Brazil to Azores / Portugal. Subsequently, Daniel Dantas was called to join the crew.

Moved by the dream of crossing the Atlantic and gaining experience (miles navigated), the 3 sailors embarked on this journey, which became a nightmare.

At the 1st stop of the sailboat, due to mechanical problems, in Mindelo / Cabo Verde, police found more than 1 ton of cocaine, hidden in the double bottom of the hull, of iron and cement and that the crew obviously did not know because they were located under the tanks and coated with cement and steel plates. The boat, during the time it was stopped at the Yacht Club of Natal / Brazil, was inspected for 6 hours by federal police with sniffer dogs and was released. At no time did the contracted Brazilians have any contact or know what the boat had hidden under steel plates, welded to the hull and lined with cement.

It should be noted that this sailboat has been for more than a year in Brazil, most of which has been under construction in the hull, which was carried out at Marina Ocema, near Salvador.

The owner of the boat known as Mr. Fox, is George ""Fox"" Saul, an English citizen, residing in Gibraltar and Norwich (UK) who is missing and apparently has a prison term established by Interpol. Mr. George Saul has been in Brazil countless times to accompany the remodeling of his boat, and on at least one occasion he was alone anchored on a semi-deserted beach of the Brazilian coast, where there was a residence and ample time and privacy to do the loading of the drug.

The three Brazilians and the French captain have been imprisoned since August. At that time there is strong pressure for them to commit guilty, including threats to their physical integrity and if found guilty they can receive a sentence of up to 15 years in prison.

The Brazilian media is already preparing a story, to be widely publicized in the country's main communication vehicles, in order to show that the crew was the victim of an international drug trafficking network.

We ask the people who know them and know the suitability of each one of them, to sign the undersigned and leave their comments, in order to sensitize the Cape Verdean authorities to the innocence of the crew, which was used by an international gang.""

Em agosto de 2017, Daniel Guerra e Rodrigo Dantas foram contratados pela agência de recrutamento de tripulação"" The Yacht Delivery Company"", com sede na Holanda, para transportarem um veleiro de 72 pés, de bandeira inglesa, saindo de Salvador/Brasil até os Açores/Portugal. Posteriormente, Daniel Dantas foi chamado para integrar a tripulação.

Movidos pelo sonho de realizarem a travessia do Atlântico e adquirirem experiência (milhas navegadas), os 3 velejadores embarcaram nessa viagem, que se tornou um pesadelo.

Na 1a parada do veleiro, por problemas mecânicos, em Mindelo/Cabo Verde, a polícia encontrou mais de 1 tonelada de cocaína, escondida no duplo fundo do casco, de ferro e cimento e que os tripulantes obviamente desconheciam, por estarem localizadas embaixo dos tanques de água e revestidos com cimento e placas de aço. O barco, no período em que esteve parado no Iate Clube de Natal/Brasil, foi vistoriado por 6 horas pela polícia federal, com cães farejadores e foi liberado. Em nenhum momento os brasileiros contratados tiveram qualquer contato ou sabiam o que o barco trazia escondido, sob placas de aço, soldadas ao casco e revestidas com cimento.

Cabe ressaltar que este veleiro, esteve por mais de um ano no Brasil, tendo a maior parte do tempo estado sob reformas no casco, que foram realizadas na Marina Ocema, próxima a Salvador.

O proprietário do barco conhecido como Mr Fox, se trata de George ""Fox"" Saul, cidadão inglês, com residência em Gibraltar e Norwich (UK) que está desaparecido e aparentemente existe um mandato de prisão, estabelecido pela Interpol. O Sr George Saul esteve inúmeras vezes no Brasil para acompanhar a remodelação de seu barco, sendo que, em pelo menos uma ocasião, ele ficou sozinho ancorado em uma praia semi deserta do litoral brasileiro, onde havia uma residência e amplo tempo e privacidade para fazer o carregamento da droga. ..

Os 3 brasileiros e o capitão francês estão presos desde agosto. Nesse momento existe uma forte pressão para que eles se assumam culpados,incluindo ameaças à integridade física e se forem considerados culpados poderão receber uma pena de até 15 anos de prisão.

A mídia brasileira já está preparando uma matéria, a ser divulgada amplamente nos principais veículos de comunicação do país, a fim de mostrar que a tripulação foi vítima de uma rede internacional de tráfico de drogas.

Solicitamos às pessoas que os conhecem e sabem da idoneidade de cada um deles, que assinem esse abaixo assinado e deixem seus comentários, à fim de sensibilizar as autoridades caboverdeanas, da inocência da tripulação, que foi usada por uma quadrilha internacional.

Dear Alex Azar,

My name is Syd. I’m a transgender student, and I am asking you to reconsider the Department of Health and Human Services memo on tightening the definition of gender to exclude transgender and gender non-conforming people from Title IX.

While you claim you support a theory of gender grounded in science, you have not consulted with biologists or medical professionals, many of whom are pioneering research suggesting that sex is not as binary as it seemed and gender even less so. Also, you advocate for genetic testing to determine an individual’s sex, which the American Medical Association specifically warns against in the case of intersex individuals as part of their code of ethics.

In 30 states people can be evicted or fired for being trans. This new policy would remove us from Title IX protections that could allow us to take these measures to court. It would prevent us from getting necessary healthcare through Medicare or Medicaid. It would place barriers in the process of applying for a new passport, driver’s license, or any other piece of identification needed for day-to-day life. Most importantly, it would be a get-out-of-jail-free card for those who harass us and a reminder to all those who face this harassment that our struggle is not important.

While I know that a policy will not stop me from existing or from resisting, this policy could endanger me and hundreds of thousands of others. It is already exhausting enough to live in a society that does not believe in my existence.

I am asking you to believe in me.

I am asking you to do what we as transgender people do every day and resist. I am asking you to resist this policy and to take that resistance up with anyone and everyone in your department. I am asking you to resist an act that would remove federal protection from 1.4 million Americans. I am asking you to give me a chance. I am asking you to listen.

Thank you for your time."

This letter is an appeal from the group ‘Global Surgery’, a group of doctors, physician associates and surgeons at Queen Elizabeth hospital who believe and advocate for access to essential surgery for all as a human right.

Along with the international human rights community, we are shocked and appalled by the needless loss of life in Gaza. The events in Sheikh Jarrah, in which Palestinian families were threatened with imminent forcible removal from their homes by Israeli police and military, amounts to flagrant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.

The United Nations (UN) currently estimates that 181 Palestinians, including 52 children, and 10 Israeli’s including 2 children have been killed thus far (1) .

The UN coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Tor Wennesland has also reported that 40 schools and four hospitals were completely or partially destroyed in Gaza and 18 buildings including four high-rise towers, including one housing several press offices, had been razed (2).

With the resultant lack of electricity, unreliable access of clean water and sewage treatment affecting hundreds of thousands, it is predicted Gaza’s health system will likely be unable to meet the needs of those injured during the violence.

We call on you in your capacity as foreign secretary, to resolutely condemn the use of indiscriminate civilian bombing by all parties and demand an immediate cessation to hostilities, respect for and implementation of international human rights law and to initiate immediate provision of aid and relief to the besieged population in Gaza.

Yours sincerely,

Global Surgery

La crise sanitaire du Covid19 a vu émerger, en mars 2020, une nouvelle notion présidant aux décisions d'interruptions administratives de certaines activités économiques réputées ""non essentielles"".

Cette notion, reçue comme blessante et dégradante par de nombreux citoyens et citoyennes dans tous les secteurs publics et privés cités, a créé une blessure plus ou moins profondes et durables en chaque humain ainsi défini dans son rôle social.

Elle les a renvoyé à leur inutilité sociale, dans une France confinée, perdant ainsi leurs repères, dans une France ayant perdu tous ses repères.

Les Arts et la Culture, pour ne citer qu'eux, ont prouvé l'indispensable rôle social, et la nature préventive de contenus audios, multimédias, et plastiques pour des personnes confinées ayant besoin d'évasion.

Nature préventive de toutes détresses, de tous désœuvrements et tous troubles à l'ordre public autant que faire se peut.

C'est pourquoi nous, citoyennes et citoyens français, lançons un Appel Unanime, dans la ligne de l'appel du Président Emmanuel Macron lors du discours du 31 mars 2020 en direct de l’usine de production de masques Kolmi-Hopen à Angers... à l'Union Nationale.

Nous demandons à Mr Le Président Emmanuel Macron, Mr Le 1er Ministre Édouard Phillipe et Mr Le Ministre de l'Économie et des Finances Bruno Le Maire, de reconnaître le caractère ""essentiel"" de toutes les activités économiques, autant dans la création d'une Richesse Sociale, que dans la création d'une Richesse Économique.

Cette Reconnaissance devra se faire lors d'un discours, conjoint ou séparé selon leur convenance, afin de réaffirmer la Valeur de chaque Être Humain dans sa Diversité, dans une Nation Unie et Indivisible, préservant, quoi qu'il en coûte, sa Souveraineté Sociale, Industrielle et Économique.

Seul cet acte Fort, Concret et Symbolique, permettra de panser des blessures dont la Nation doit se passer, dans un contexte de divisions et de clivages inutiles, pouvant conduire à une fracture sociale aggravée.

According to WHO, washing hands frequently, maintaining social distance, avoiding touching eyes and nose, and practicing respiratory hygiene are among the basic preventive measures for this deadly virus. But a regular weekday involves traveling to work through private or public transport, interacting/getting in contact with several people on the way to work and within office premises, touching objects and cracking jokes while simultaneously panicking about the widespread virus. While it is easy to follow the prescribed preventive measures when confined to the four walls of homes, following them otherwise is a difficult task. Hence, the measure  to follow the basic preventive measures is avoiding commuting and going to work. Also, thanks to the advancement in communication technology and cheap internet, going to a central place of work isn't necessary.Employees can telecommute or Work From Home.

Sign this petition to ask the Health Minister of India to put this preventive measure to action and order organisations to make it compulsory for their employees to work from home till the virus subsides.

終止港鐵營運 Crossrail Elizabeth Line 的14億英鎊合同

港鐵的子公司Cross Crossrail已獲得價值14億英鎊的營運新的伊麗莎白線合同，這是150億英鎊Crossrail項目的第一大階段。

自TFL於2014年授予該特許權以來， 港鐵已有連翻營運及管理上的失誤， 在英國公眾期望獲得高水平的服務下 ，倫敦市長和TFL 應對MTR重新進行審查，並應該由於對MTR沒有信心去繼續履行合同而終止合同。

以下是終止本合同的六個關鍵原因及其營運失敗的證據：

2019年9月17日，在繁忙時段港鐵紅磡站有列車出軌引發混亂和乘客受傷，因為此港鐵難以維持運作。

HK $ 97.1billion沙田至中環線的一樁醜聞證明了地鐵公司管理不善的證據。

2019年8月24日，在中國施加壓力後，地鐵在觀塘的法律抗議活動附近關閉了4個車站。

港鐵在721元朗站發生恐怖襲擊時，顯示出完全無法應對緊急情況，危及乘客的生命。

2019年8月31日，防暴警察衝進太子站，並用暴力對付可疑的示威者，MTR被指與警察串通以掩飾死亡事件和警察殘暴的證據。

https://www.cvsanordic.net/in-depth-CVS

Our daughter is a sufferer of this condition, but more recently she has become plagued with IBS/irregular and slowed peristalsis which is excruciating for her and exacerbates her CVS, it has overcome our life. We have been struggling with this since she was 13 months old. While we did not receive a formal diagnosis of what was wrong until 2015 (aged 6 yrs) when her school attendance dropped to 71 percent. We endured years prior being told there was nothing physically wrong with her, she was simply just prone to stomach upset and we were being overly cautious, paranoid, hysterical and neurotic parents every time she would have an episode as it required either being taken to hospital or to see a GP and the episodes would advance through it’s phases rapidly. Now at age 9 she is having as patterned 19-24 episodes in a year, resulting in missing up to 33 days a year of school, and she is symptomatic almost every other day which means she sometimes incapable of completing a full day of school.

Having been left with no answers, no help and no support for our daughter, we decided to take a pro active stance after we moved house to an entirely new area. I researched and googled until the early hours for months and came across the CVSA Nordic website. It soon became very clear that this was possibly what was wrong with daughter. We followed the advice on the website and started keeping episode diaries. These listed what she had been doing up to 24hrs prior to the episode, what she had to eat, how many hours sleep she had, what symptoms she was presenting with and how long the episode lasted. We did this for a few years and then showed our new GP who has been an amazing source of support and strength to us. It was then “suspected” she had CVS, referred to the Paed team at the hospital and it was confirmed, diagnosed. You can read what this is like for my daughter below.

No two sufferers of CVS are the same and cases can not be treated the same. CVS has no known cause, it has no cure. It can only ever be managed the best it can. We know that in our daughters case there are identified triggers that set her episodes off, normal every day activities that we all take for granted, we have tried many different techniques and drug therapies to minimise exposure and reduce episodes but we can not stop exposure to life, all attempts to reduce frequency have failed and while we have treatment to administer to stop vomiting during an episode it does not remove the additional symptoms that come with it, so we have now got a default setting that our daughter has to be sedated in the hope that deep sleep resets her system. Her episodes are very different from lifestyle activated episodes through physical exertion, allergies, sleep deprivation, exhaustion, positive and negative excitement etc to episodes activated from viral or bacterial infections. The latter are much more severe and much worse usually resulting in hospitalisation. Normally hospitalisation is counter therapeutic and our daughter requires much more extensive home care than other children the same age who do not have a disability or other chronic conditions. She also has dental issues that have been picked up by her dentist. CVS affects the mouth and teeth in similar ways to diseases associated with chronic vomiting, such as bulimia, and can cause tooth sensitivity and erosion, cavities, periodontal (gum) disease, dry mouth, salivary gland enlargement and trauma to the oral tissue. Our daughter can not enjoy the normal activities that children her age or even her younger sibling can with sports, she is unable to do any kind of sport activity. While her class is partaking in the normal exercise regime at school, hers is altered and she  is excluded due to the limitations CVS inflicts upon her.

In the UK it is not recognised as a disability. This condition can leave a sufferer very sick and vomiting for hours, or even days, at a time. It can be a frightening condition that affects everyday life.

I am asking the Department for Work and Pensions of the UK Government to recognize this debilitating condition as what it is, a disability. It disables my daughter in almost all aspects of her life. Adult sufferers and caretakers struggle to hold down a job, due to absences, which is an added strain and stress on them, Where am I going to find the money to pay my bills as I haven't been able to work this month??If CVS was recognised as a disability, quality of life would be better. Sufferers and caretakers would have a usual, regular income and wouldn't have the stress of not being able to work or constantly being fired.

Please sign and share my petition to urge the Government to recognise CVS as a disability, so that sufferers like my daughter can get the support they need. There is no mention of CVS in any of DWP decision makers guidance. I feel it were to be listed and recognised properly as the disabling and debilitating condition is truly is, sufferers who are so struck down with this condition that it does impact and impair their daily lives, when they do make a claim for help it would lessen the risk to the stressors of having to go through the lengthy processes of Mandatory Reconsiderations, Appeals, Tribunals. All which are triggers points leading to exacerbating episodes. The DWP would become more educated, understanding and knowledgeable of what this disease really is.

Some cases are so severe that a sufferer requires immediate hospitalisation, for Iv fluids (dangerous dehydration) and Iv pain relief. A sufferer can be left bed ridden or hospitalised for days. The number of ""attacks"" can vary, as can the space between attacks. Between attacks, after recovery, a sufferer can often feel fine and sometimes the sufferer is symptomatic most the time in between due to the cycles not being broke.

During an attack a sufferer can experience retching and vomiting that often starts in the night or early morning •vomiting up to five or six times rapid pace in 15 minutes, and up to 20+ times in 60 minutes, for up to 10 days •may not be able to move or respond •other possible symptoms: -abdominal pain, -diarrhoea, - fever, - dizziness, - headache, - sensitivity to light, - extremely pale skin, - drowsiness or unresponsiveness,- drooling or spitting excess saliva, and many more

Not only do we need recognition of this disease as a disability but we need more awareness of the condition. Right now there is no cure, just management. I believe that this is because its not commonly known about. CVS research is still in its infancy"

----------

Did you know, every year, on the summer solstice, thousands of dogs are rounded up to be eaten in Yulin, China as part of a Dog Meat Festival? We believe that this cruel “festival” has no place in the 21st century.

There are so many reasons to end this horrific festival -- warning, the following information may be upsetting.

Many of the dogs that are killed are stolen household pets or are watchdogs of rural families. Allowing the Dog Meat Festival to continue is like endorsing dog theft, which supplies the dog meat industry.

The Yulin Dog Meat Festival is also a dangerous food safety issue. Dogs sold on the market are sick, poisoned and dying animals. They suffer from horrendous conditions during the long distance, trans-provincial journeys, many days without food and water and may carry contagious disease.

We appeal to you to act in the interest of public health, food safety, animal welfare, and the image of Guangxi and China. The Yulin Dog Meat Festival is a business operation that undermines the national and public interest. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region government is at a historical juncture. The Dog Meat Festival must end.

By signing our petition, you’re joining a global movement with like-minded people who want to shut down this heinous festival and trade. You’ll have the opportunity to be involved in both online and in-person events happening around the world.

Thank you,

The Wandoan farming community, who thought its farmland was protected as ‘strategic cropping land’, has been served with a notice from coal seam gas (CSG) company QGC proposing to strip 175 farms of their strategic cropping land status.

QCG has given these farmers just 21 days to complete farm surveys and collate evidence of farming history in order to prevent the foreign-owned  resource company from removing 125,000 hectares from  the Queensland strategic cropping land trigger map.

The timing of QGC’s application has only deepened the community’s distrust of and disillusionment with the CSG industry.  By lodging the application just before the repeal of the Strategic Cropping Land Act 2011, QGC may negate the need to comply with more stringent environmental protection measures set under new legislation (the  Regional Planning Interests Act 2014) if wanting to pursue CSG developments in the area.

It is a completely unrealistic for QGC to expect that 175 field surveys can be commissioned and completed over 125,000 hectares within just 21 days.

To do so is completely out of line with QGC’s ‘purported’ corporate principles of treating people ‘with fairness, respect and decency.’

Such conduct, though legal due to a poorly constructed section of the strategic cropping land legislation, simply serves to further distress farmers already at their ‘wit’s end’ from dealing with CSG companies. Community depression is already endemic.

Such conduct may also result in significant areas of valuable cropping land being afforded virtually no protection from the negative environmental impacts of CSG developments.

Please sign to tell QGC to stop bullying Wandoan farmers and to treat them with fairness, respect and decency by allowing them at least 45 days to prepare submissions to prove their strategic cropping land status."
60,Save American Indian & Indigenous Studies @ UNC-Chapel Hill!,,,First Nations Graduate Circle,"Chapel Hill, NC, United States",5959,"Apr. 19, 2022",https://assets.change.org/photos/4/ny/xt/JdnyXTtQEVjnxed-800x450-noPad.jpg?1650393195,"In fall 2022, UNC-Chapel Hill—the flagship university for the state with one of the largest populations of Native people east of the Mississippi—will eliminate its American Indian and Indigenous Studies (AIIS) major concentration and minor. Less than 20 years after the establishment of the AIIS concentration, the administration will effectively end the program through curriculum revisions to the American Studies Department, where AIIS@UNC is housed. This change will prohibit all incoming students from formally declaring a focus in AIIS.    The dissolution of AIIS and its incorporation into the American Studies major and minor constitute erasure. UNC administrators made this change without consulting, nor seeking consent from Native students and other stakeholders. Through these actions, the University erodes its special relationship with and obligation to the state’s Native Nations and its Native students, faculty, and staff. In a form of twenty-first-century assimilation, these changes undermine the disciplinary integrity of AIIS by subsuming it under American Studies.   The elimination of AIIS is just the latest blow to the Native UNC community. In the last two years, Larry Chavis (Lumbee), former Director of the American Indian Center at UNC, resigned his position because of chronic underfunding, and Malinda Maynor Lowery (Lumbee), history professor and former Director for the Center for the Study of the American South at UNC, left her position for Emory University because of a pattern of disinvestment in Indigenous Studies and the devaluing of faculty expertise. The decreasing number of Native faculty and faculty engaged in AIIS research is mirrored in the waning number of Native students on campus: since 2011, the number of Native students enrolled at UNC-Chapel Hill has dropped by 33%.    On October 10, 2021, the Native campus community and our allies joined the University in celebrating the second Monday of October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day. In his declaration, Chancellor Guskiewicz described UNC as “home” to American Indian and Indigenous Studies, “offering majors, minors, and graduate degrees.” Native and AIIS faculty and students take the concept of “home” seriously. For many of us, the state and the region have been our home for thousands of years.    Holding the Chancellor to his word, we call for the University to remain home to AIIS@UNC. We seek the immediate restoration of the concentration and a commitment to protect, preserve, and grow AIIS@UNC, with the ultimate goal of developing a standalone Department of American Indian and Indigenous Studies.

Help us save AIIS@UNC by signing your name and sharing this petition!

And if you’re a current undergraduate at UNC and want to show your solidarity, declare a major or minor in AIIS TODAY!

Ad Animal Equality ci battiamo ogni giorno per creare un mondo in cui gli animali non vengano","['Petizione diretta a José Cil', 'Joshua Kobza', 'Fernando Machado', 'Paul Lacy-Smith', 'Rodrigo Musiello']",Animal Equality Italia,"Milano, Italia",272321,Data di lancio 11 nov 2020,https://assets.change.org/photos/5/dg/cy/qzDGCyIMYnViOXB-800x450-noPad.jpg?1605115131,"Con più di 11.000 punti vendita in 65 diversi Paesi, Burger King è una della più grandi catene di fast food al mondo.

Sul suo sito, Burger King definisce la sua responsabilità aziendale come ""uno sguardo che va oltre i risultati di bilancio tenendo in considerazione l'impatto di tutto ciò che [l’azienda] fa"". Eppure, nel caso delle galline ovaiole all’interno della sua catena di approvvigionamento globale, l’azienda sta chiaramente anteponendo il profitto alla sofferenza patita da milioni di animali.

Il gigante del fast food, infatti, continua a supportare allevamenti in cui le galline sono confinate all’interno di gabbie minuscole e sporche.

Le gabbie in cui questi animali sono costretti a vivere sono talmente piccole e affolate da non permettere loro di esprimersi in modo naturale. Spesso le loro parti del corpo rimangono incastrate nella gabbia, e questo può provocare fratture e rottura delle ossa, deformità e perdita del piumaggio. Alcune galline, esauste o incapaci di muoversi, muoiono calpestate dai propri simili.

Burger King, rifiutandosi di assumersi un impegno a livello globale a smettere di utilizzare uova di galline ovaiole allevate in gabbia, sta rimanendo indietro rispetto ad altre centinaia di aziende che, invece, hanno deciso di fare quest’importante passo avanti.

Tra le aziende che hanno deciso di abbandonare le gabbie ci sono Unilever, Nestlé, Aldi, InterContinental Hotels, Sodexo, Mondelez, Compass Group, Shake Shack, Famous Brands, Costa Coffee e Barilla.

Ad Animal Equality ci battiamo ogni giorno per creare un mondo in cui gli animali non vengano allevati ed uccisi ma, nel frattempo, non possiamo voltare le spalle a milioni di galline ovaiole costrette a passare la loro breve vita in gabbia, ed è per questo che abbiamo deciso di fare il possibile per alleviare la loro sofferenza.

Ci siamo uniti a più di 80 organizzazioni per la protezione degli animali allevati a scopo alimentare che fanno parte di Open Wing Alliance, una coalizione internazionale di cui siamo membri attivi, per chiedere al gigante del fast food di fare la propria parte per gli animali pubblicando una policy a livello globale in cui si impegna a smettere di utilizzare uova di galline allevate in gabbia.

È arrivato il momento per Burger King di soddisfare gli standard minimi di benessere animale e unirsi a tutte quelle aziende che hanno deciso di abolire una delle pratiche più crudeli dell'industria alimentare.

Per favore, unisciti alla campagna internazionale per dire a Burger King che è arrivato il momento di pubblicare una policy globale in cui si impegna a smettere di utilizzare uova di galline ovaiole allevate in gabbia, alleviando i tormenti patiti da milioni di animali.

Fai sentire la voce degli animali e manda, insieme a noi, un messaggio forte e chiaro a Burger King: basta supportare il maltrattamento sugli animali!"

Importance and new goals

The directive is on the way to the last vote in the european parliament. The voices against Article 13 in its current form are getting heard. It is being discussed throughout the parliament and in the public. More and more people are gettiing aware of this important topic.

Comments by critics

Issues such as the potentially EU-wide ancillary copyright law and content recognition technologies - commonly known as “upload filters” - are still unresolved. We therefore call for those involved in the drafting and revising of such laws to deal better with the content and consequences of the digital aspect.

Our demands

Dear Members of Parliament: Stay well informed! Recognize the consequences the proposed drafts would have for the private user as well as for the economy. Continue to decide against directives similar to Article 11 and 13 or which restrict freedom of information in any other way.

No one is giving our Seniors a voice.  The government priority on all opening and releasing of Covid 19 restrictions is economically driven.  If we can figure out how to safely get our hair cut, take our pet to a dog park or golf, certainly, society can figure out a way to safely visit our loved ones in long term care (or even those self-isolating at home).

Technology is not the answer. Many seniors don't understand technology and many do not have it available.

Continued lock down is not the answer.  Our loved ones are confined to  their rooms and stare at the TV or out the window, alone.

We must find a solution that balances compassion and acceptable risks. My neighbour Dolly, aged 93 was a child in Germany during WWII claims that Covid 19 isolation is worse than WWII because during the war, she had her family and friends to help get through the tough times.

I’m Isabel’s Mum, and I’m campaigning for food companies to change their product packaging after my beautiful nine-year-old daughter died from a severe allergic reaction when eating the wrong biscuit. I don’t want any parents to go through what I have been through these last few months. Let me tell you why.

My daughter Isabel went into anaphylactic shock after eating an allergen-containing biscuit wrapped in almost identical packaging to the non-allergen version. It was a tragic mistake, but this is a tragedy that should be avoidable.

That’s why I’m campaigning to make sure that allergen-containing products are clearly labelled on the front of the packet. Not just in the small print of the ingredient list, but much more visible.

There haven’t been any real changes to the way Food Standards Australia label food packaging for allergens in 16 years. Think about how much has changed in regards to food allergies since that time. It’s a completely different world. As parents, we need Food Standards Australia to do more to help keep our kids safe.

I am calling for an allergen symbol to be implemented on the front of food package as a warning, just like the symbols we see letting us know food products are gluten-free, Australian made, halal, or approved by the Heart Foundation. Why do these symbols exist and not an allergen one, when allergies can be fatal? An allergen symbol could help prevent this.

These changes should include mandatory warnings for any differences between products that are within the same brand, and clear warnings when ingredients are added to, or removed from, any products.

I am reaching out to prevent any more deaths due to something that should have been changed a long time ago.

Regulations on food packaged labelling need to change.

Please help me make this change, and help me honour the memory of my beautiful angel, Isabel.

Stimati lideri social-democrati,

Ca lideri al social-democraţilor, aveţi influenţă în Partidul Socialiştilor Europeni şi puterea de a propune excluderea social-democraţilor români. Social-democraţii români sunt “social-democraţi” doar cu numele şi distrug încrederea în democraţia socială din întreaga Europa. Ei au pierdut sprijinul oamenilor şi acum recurg la măsuri coercitive pentru a rămâne la putere.

În ultimele luni, au schimbat legile Justiţiei pentru a-i salva pe politicienii corupţi de la închisoare şi, prin aceasta, au slăbit statul de drept în România. Mai mult, au demis-o pe şefa DNA pentru a opri procesul de curăţare a corupţiei în România. Acum, ei doresc să numească pe cineva care să le urmeze ordinele, la fel cum au făcut cu Poliţia şi Jandarmeria.

Într-o ţară în care mor oameni nevinovaţi, din cauza administrării cu rea-credinţă şi incompetente, schimbările în sistemul judiciar şi demiterea şefei DNA au împins milioane de români din străinătate să reacţioneze prin organizarea unui protest, pe 10 august. Ei au dorit pur şi simplu să demonstreze că încă le pasă de persoanele pe care le-au lăsat în urmă în România, pentru a protesta împotriva politicienilor corupţi şi pentru a cere paşnic Guvernului să demisioneze.

Din nefericire, guvernul social-democrat avea alte planuri şi a decis să folosească forţa Jandarmeriei împotriva oamenilor care s-au adunat în Piaţa Victoriei pentru a protesta paşnic. Peste 440 de persoane au fost rănite de Jandarmeria care a folosit tunuri cu apă, grenade lacrimogene, spray cu piper şi alte grenade, precum şi forţa directă. Printre persoanele rănite sunt bărbaţi, femei, copii, vârstnici şi chiar persoane cu dizabilităţi. De asemenea, printre persoanele atacate se găsesc rezidenţi din toate statele europene de origine română.

Mulţi protestatari au fost luaţi în custodie de către Jandarmerie pentru a insufla teama în protestatari şi pentru a opri continuarea protestului. Dreptul de a protesta, asigurat de Convenţia Europeană a Drepturilor Omului (art.9-11), este în pericol. Există zeci de dovezi-video online de la protest, care arată amploarea violenţei la care au fost expuşi cetăţenii din România (printre care şi rezidenţi din Diaspora).

Este clar că guvernul social-democrat nu are nicio intenţie de a demisiona paşnic iar acum încearcă să creeze o diviziune în societatea românească, aducând instabilitate la graniţa de est a Uniunii Europene. Luând în considerare toate celelalte probleme cu care se confruntă Europa, o Românie instabilă este ultimul lucru pe care îl doriţi. Între 3 şi 5 milioane de români au părăsit ţara până acum, dar dacă acest lucru va continua, numărul acestora ar putea fi uşor dublat.

“Declaraţia principiilor” PSE, care trebuie urmată de toate partidele membre, este dispreţuită de social-democraţii români, în special art.1 despre democraţie, art.2 despre statul de drept şi art.3 despre controlul oamenilor. De asemenea, am dori să vă reamintim art.12 despre solidaritatea internaţională. “Asigurarea prosperităţii, a stabilităţii şi, mai ales, a păcii de lungă durată necesită o coordonare eficientă în domeniul internaţional bazat pe democraţie, respect reciproc şi drepturile omului”.

Luând în considerare toate acestea, noi, cetăţeni europeni, considerăm că social-democraţii români nu mai reprezintă principiile socialiste europene şi, prin urmare, vă rugăm să cereţi excluderea lor din Partidul Socialist European şi să condamnaţi acţiunile lor împotriva poporului român.

Dear leaders of the social-democrats,

As the leaders of the social-democrats, you have the influence in the Party of European Socialists, and the power to propose the Romanian Social-Democrats to be excluded. The Romanian social-democrats, are “social-democrats” just in name and are ruining the trust in the social democracy all over Europe. They have lost the support of the people, and now they resort to coercive measures to stay in power.

In the past months, they have changed the judicial law in order to save the corrupt politicians from being jailed and by doing that, they have weakened the rule of law in Romania. Furthermore they fired the leader of the Anti-Corruption Agency, in order to stop the process of cleaning up corruption in Romania. Now, they want to name someone that will follow their orders instead, just like they have done with the Police and the Gendarmerie (some sort of a riot police).

In a country where innocent people die, due to malevolent and incompetent administration, the changes in the judiciary and the firing of the Anti-Corruption Agency, has pushed the millions of Romanians abroad to react, by organizing a protest on 10th of August. They simply wanted to show that they still care about the people they left behind in Romania to deal with corrupt politicians, and ask for the government to resign in peace.

Unfortunately the social-democrat government had other plans, and it decided to use the force of the “Gendarmerie (Riot Police)” against the people that gathered on the Victory Square to protest peacefully. Over 440 people were injured by the “Gendarmerie” which used water cannons, teargas grenades, pepper spray, and other grenades, as well as direct force. Among the people injured there are men, women, children, elderly and even disabled people.

Many protesters were taken into custody by the riot police, in order to instill fear in the protesters, and stop the continuation of the protest. The right to protest, ensured by the European Convention on Human Rights (art.9-11), is being under threat. There are dozens of video proofs online from the protest, that show the extent of the violence, that the citizens of Romania (European Union) were exposed to.

It is clear, that the social-democrat government has no intention of resigning in peace, and now it is trying to create a divide in the Romanian society, bringing instability on the Eastern border of the European Union. Considering all the other problems that Europe is facing, an unstable Romania is the last thing you want. Between 3 and 5 million Romanians have left the country so far, but if this continues, those numbers could easily double.

The “Declaration of Principles” of PES, that must be followed by all member parties, is being kept in disdain by Romanian social-democrats, especially art.1 about democracy, art.2 about rule of law and art.3 about control of the people. Also, we would like to remind you art.12 about international solidarity. “Ensuring long lasting prosperity, stability and above all, peace requires effective coordination in the international realm based on democracy, mutual respect and human rights.”

Taking all these into consideration, we, concerned European Citizens, feel that the Romanian Social Democratic does not represent the European Socialist principles anymore and thus, we kindly ask you to pressure for their exclusion from the European Socialist Party and condemn their actions against the people of Romania.

Kära Stefan Löfven!

Som ledare av Socialdemokraterna i Sverige har du möjligheten att påverka de Europeiska Socialdemokraters Parti (PES) samt makt att föreslå att det Rumänska socialdemokratiska partiet bör uteslutas. Det rumänska socialdemokratiska partiet är endast socialdemokrater i teorin, och deras erkännande som socialdemokrater ödelägger tilliten för socialdemokratin i hela Europa. De har tappat det rumänska folkets förtroende, och använder nu tvång och våld för att stanna vid makten.

Under de senaste månaderna har de genomfört lagändringar för att skydda korrupta politiker från att drömmas och fängslas, och således urholkat den rumänska rättsstaten. Utöver detta har de avskedat ledaren av den rumänska antikorruptionsbyrån, för att stävja det antikorruptionsarbete som pågår i landet. I hennes plats vill de nu tillsätta en ledare som kan gå deras ärenden, vilket de redan lyckats med inom polisväsendet (inkluderat kravallpolisen).

I ett land där oskyldiga människor dör till följd av en illvillig och inkompetent regering, har dessa förändringar i rättssystemet samt avskedandet av landets främsta förespråkare för antikorruption tvingat tusentals rumäner som lever utanför Rumäniens gränser att återvända hem för en organiserad demonstration. Denna tog plats den 10e augusti 2018. Dessa europeiska medborgare av rumänskt ursprung ville visa sitt stöd för de vänner och släktingar som stannat kvar i landet, och som dagligen kämpar för en vardag fri från förtryck och korruption, samt be den nuvarande regeringen att frivilligt och fredligt avgå.

Dessvärre hade det rumänska socialistiska partiet andra planer. De använde sig av kravallpolis mot de demonstranter som fredligt samlats på Victorieitorget. Över 440 människor skadades när kravallpolis använde sig av vattenkanoner, granater med tårgas, andra typer av granater, pepparspray och direkt våld. Bland de sårade fanns män, kvinnor, barn, äldre och handikappade. Bland de skadade fanns även svenska medborgare.

Många demonstranter fängslades av polis, för att skapa rädsla och förhindra fortsatta demonstrationer. Rätten att demonstrera, som styrks av den europeiska människorättskonventionen (artikel 9-11), är således under direkt hot. Det finns dussintals med videobevis som påvisar vidden av det övervåld som rumänska likväl som svenska medborgare utsattes för.

Det står nu klart att den socialdemokratiska regeringen i Rumänien inte ämnar att fredligt avgå. Istället verkar de för att splittra den rumänska befolkningen, och skapa instabilitet i den europeiska unionens östra gräns. Med tanke på de utmaningar den europeiska unionen redan står inför, ligger det i allas intresse att behålla ett stabilt Rumänien. Mellan 3 och 5 miljoner rumäner har hittills lämnat landet, men om dessa oroligheter får fortsätta, kan detta snabbt fördubblas.

De europeiska socialdemokraternas principdeklaration, vilka skall följas av alla medlemmar, uppehålls inte av det rumänska socialdemokratiska partiet - i synnerhet inte artikel 1 om demokrati, artikel 2 om lag och rätt, samt artikel 3 om medborgares rättigheter. Därutöver önskar vi påminna dig om den artikel som behandlar internationell solidaritet: ”Ensuring long lasting prosperity, stability, and above all, peace requires effective coordination in the international realm based on democracy, mutual respect and human rights.”

Med allt detta taget i beaktning menar vi, bekymrade europeiska- och svenska medborgare, att de rumänska socialdemokraterna inte representerar de europeiska socialdemokratiska principerna, och därför vill vi vänligast be dig om att exkludera dem från de Europeiska Socialdemokraterna samt fördöma deras handlingar gentemot det rumänska folket.

Med vänlig hälsning,

Мы обращаемся к вам с просьбой защитить тысячи замученных животных Казахстана, где ежедневно отловы сжигают в печах сотни собак и кошек. Зачастую ещё живых. В Казахстане XXI века варварское отношение к животным - это норма. Закона об их защите нет.  Для многих жителей Казахстана животное - это мусор, сорняк и жизнь его ничего не стоит. Любой житель страны может позвонить в отлов и сообщить о бездомном животном, заранее обрекая его на неизбежную гибель.

Кратко о ситуации в Казахстане.

1.    В Казахстане НЕ РАБОТАЕТ закон о защите прав животных.

2.    В Казахстане НЕ РАБОТАЮТ программы стерилизации и вакцинации.

3.    В Казахстане НЕТ представительств международных организаций по защите животных.

4.    В Казахстане НЕТ единого зоозащитного движения.

5.    Волонтерские группы в Казахстане существуют, но их усилия по спасению животных слишком разрозненны и хаотичны. Между волонтерами нет сплочённости в борьбе за общее дело, и поэтому, спасая многих животных, они не могут помочь всем.

6.    Волонтеры из разных стран пытаются помочь животным Казахстана. Они спасают собак и кошек из отловов и добиваются изменения законодательства страны. Но, находясь за тысячи километров от Казахстана, волонтерам трудно повлиять на ситуацию по телефону и через Интернет. Как итог, результаты их деятельности незначительны. Финансовые возможности волонтеров ограничены, и поэтому количество вывозимых из отловов животных минимально.

7.    Убийство бездомных животных в Казахстане превратилось в масштабный бизнес. Государство платит отловам за каждого пойманного и забитого ими зверя.  Передержки собак, ветеринарные клиники, зоотакси - все наживаются на волонтёрах, вынужденных пользоваться их услугами для спасения животных.

Что происходит на улицах Казахстана?

Сотрудники отловов ""выходят на охоту"" ежедневно. Они хватают всех, кто попадется у них на пути: взрослых особей, щенков и котят.  Работники изоляторов временного содержания (как они официально себя называют) забирают и домашних животных -  в отловах много собак в ошейниках. Пойманным животным дается в среднем три дня, чтобы им улыбнулась удача и за ними пришел спаситель (хозяин или волонтёр). Для остальных исход один – мучительная смерть. Согласно законодательству Казахстана, животные должны содержаться в отловах в течение 60 суток с тем, чтобы нашелся их владелец. Если хозяин не найден, то зверь официально приобретает статус ничейного, и тогда отлов, как новый собственник, принимает решение о судьбе узника. Но в реальности все не так! Животных отстреливают прямо на улицах или доставляют в изоляторы и уничтожают в течение 2-3 дней. 50 собак и 100 щенков за день в отлове – обычное дело. Условия содержания в таких концлагерях адские. Зачастую животных не кормят и не дают им воды. Сидя на бетонном полу клеток, собаки замерзают насмерть. На своих страницах в Инстаграм отловы публикуют фото собак, кошек, котят и щенков, ожидающих смерть -  глаза животных наполнены болью и ужасом.

Как животных убивают?

Отловы очень жестоки по отношению к животным. Петли, используемые для их поимки, ломают шеи, душат и перерезают им горло. Отстрел собак и кошек отравленными дротиками или пулями – это вполне стандартная ситуация. В отловах для убийств используется миорелаксант, под действием которого животное долго и мучительно задыхается - это в лучшем случае. В худшем -  кошек и собак кидают в печь ещё живыми. Как можно представить себе такую пытку в XXI веке? Лица, совершающие подобное, в большинстве стран цивилизованного мира считаются психопатами.

А что же власти Казахстана?

Власти остаются равнодушными к страданиям животных, и они жестоки в своем бездействии.  Бриджит Бардо в 2019 году в ужасе и отчаянии обратилась к Президенту Казахстана и, ссылаясь на продолжающие поступать к ней отзывы по поводу гибели собак и кошек в этой стране, просила главу государства озаботиться судьбой животных.

Для этого она предлагала помощь специалистов своего фонда (https://tengrinews.kz/world_news/brijit-bardo-pojalovalas-tokaevu-jestokoe-obraschenie-386681/).

В своем ответе Бриджит Бардо в феврале 2020 года, Президент Казахстана Касым-Жомарт Кемелевич Токаев рассуждал о милосердии нации и о необходимости уделять внимание защите животных. Он также обещал издать закон о правах животных (https://liter.kz/tokaev-otvetil-na-pismo-brizhit-bardo-obrativshejsya-s-prosboj-o-zashhite-zhivotnyh/).

1 марта 2022 в Казахстане вступил в силу закон о защите животных. Но он не работает, и страдания животных продолжаются: их смерть и мучения повсюду. Никем не контролируемые отловы продолжают зверствовать и обещают своим подписчикам в Инстаграм новый ""интересный"" поворот в развитии драмы под названием ""Зоофашизм в Казахстане""!

Как же так, уважаемый Касым-Жомарт Кемелевич Токаев?

Где же оно, так гордо Вами заявленное миру милосердие нации? Почему отловы не соблюдают прописанный правилами 60-дневный срок содержания животных, убивая их уже через три дня? И это лишь самый малый из их грехов!

Каковы пути решения проблемы негуманного отношения к животным в Казахстане?

1.      Президент и Правительство Казахстана должны доработать закон о защите животных и контролировать его исполнение.

2.      Президент должен прекратить уничтожение бродячих животных.

3.      Президент должен способствовать принятию программы гуманного регулирования численности бродячих животных через:

•  отлов - стерилизацию - вакцинацию - возврат в места обитания;

• поиск для них нового дома;

• введение моратория на работу отловов до тех пор, пока в стране не будет обеспечено исполнение закона о защите животных;

• информационно-образовательную работу с населением и воспитание в гражданах Казахстана доброго и уважительного отношения к животным.

Что Можете Сделать Лично Вы?

Каждый из вас может помочь спасти безвинных животных!

Мы просим всех, кому небезразлична судьба животных Казахстана:

ТРЕБУЙТЕ:

-  доработать закон о защите животных и контролировать его исполнение,

-   прекратить уничтожение бездомных собак и кошек,

-   проконтролировать соблюдение отловами установленных правил,

-   провести проверку и аудит отловов Казахстана, и по факту выявленных правонарушений завести уголовные дела в отношении виновных в несанкционированном убийстве животных и в расхищении государственного бюджета, выделенного на их содержание,

-  принять программы гуманного регулирования численности собак и кошек через ОСВВ (отлов-стерилизация-вакцинация-возврат),

-  ввести мораторий на работу отловов до тех пор, пока в стране не будет обеспечено исполнение закона о защите животных;

- воспитывать в гражданах страны доброе отношение к братьям нашим меньшим.

Пишите и в уважительной форме высказывайте свое отношение к:

-сложившей в Казахстане ситуации с бродячими животными;

-антисанитарии и регулярным убийствам в изоляторах временного содержания;

-отлову домашних собак и кошек;

-отстрелам животных на улице, часто на глазах у детей.

Только все вместе мы сможем обратить внимание властей на эту проблему!

Люди могут защитить себя сами, а животные – нет!

Update. April 2022. The law system of Kazakhstan doesn't protect animals' rights. Their newly enacted animals’ protection legislation doesn’t work. The barbarian murder of beautiful souls continues.

Mr. President of Kazakhstan, Say NO to Slaughtering Stray Animals in your country!

We appeal for public to help protect thousands of unwanted animals in Kazakhstan. There the Animal Control Centres use ovens, designed specifically for the purpose of burning to death hundreds of dogs and cats every day. Often the animals are fully conscious when thrown into the ovens to be burnt.

Kazakhstan in the 21st century is an epitome of a barbaric culture, that not only turns a blind eye to animal cruelty but actively condones it. With both moral indifference and lack of effective legislation. The legal system of Kazakhstan does not protect animal rights, but quite the opposite. The homeless dogs and cats are treated like garbage. The unwanted animals in this country are as insignificant as a hand tool. To add more misery to the lives of unwanted animals, a hotline has now come into force, allowing residents of Kazakhstan to report stray dogs and cats 24/7.

Here is a brief overview of the current situation in Kazakhstan.

1. There is NO animal protection law in Kazakhstan.

2. Their neutering/vaccination programs DO NOT WORK.

3. There are NO animal rights groups in Kazakhstan (according to www.worldanimal.net )

4. The killing of stray animals in Kazakhstan has become a hugely profitable business. The government pays a premium for each dog that is caught and destroyed. The fees of illegal dog boarding facilities, veterinary clinics fees (the Animal Control Centres are hotbeds of diseases), animal taxis rates have skyrocketed. The exorbitant fees come directly from the pockets of volunteers, who have no other choice but to use their services for rescued animals.

5. The volunteer organizations in Kazakhstan are not an organised group. Yes, they are saving many animals, but they are powerless to rescue all of them.

6. The volunteers from different countries have joined up with several groups to try and force change.  Unfortunately, they must coordinate a rescue operation by telephone and the internet as they all live many thousands of kilometres from Kazakhstan. Up until now the results of their long-distance activity have not had a significant effect. The financial resources of these groups are very limited, as such they are unable to fund the bigger rescue projects the defenceless animals desperately need.

What happens on streets of Kazakhstan?

The Animal Control Department catch animals in the streets, aiming for dogs, cats, kittens, and puppies. Shockingly, they also prey on microchipped domestic animals, some of the dogs are wearing collars when they get caught. Not a single soul can escape from the killing brigades. Once captured, the animals are then granted two to three days for an owner to be found, if no one steps forward to claim them, the animals get savagely murdered.

According to the law in Kazakhstan, the captured animals should be kept alive for duration of 60 days and, if there is no owner found, then the animal officially gains an unwanted/unclaimed status.  It then becomes a possession of the Animal Control Organisation, who makes a final decision on the fate of the animal. But in real life this is not so! The Animal Control Organizations shoot the animals on the streets, and any that survive the shooting are brought to the killing centres to get destroyed within 2-3 days. The number of animals brought to each killing centre daily could be as many as 50 dogs and 100 puppies. The conditions in the centres where the animals are waiting for their death are horrific. Animals get riddled with infections, NO food or water are provided for them, they get frozen to death. One way or another, the outcome for them is certain, imminent death. The Centres post on their Instagram accounts photos of animals destined to die by a horrible painful death – their eyes are filled with pain and fear.

How do animals get killed?

The range of  methods used by Animal controls in Kazakhstan to destroy animals is truly endless: strangulation and shooting with poisoned darts amongst many other ways.  In Kazakhstan live animals are burned straight after the substances that cause paralysis have been used on them. Can you imagine such abhorrent torture exists in the 21st century? Those who commit such crimes, are considered psychopaths in most parts of the civilised world.

Where does the President of Kazakhstan stand on animal issues?

The authorities remain indifferent to the suffering of animals, and they are cruel in their inaction. In 2019 a French film star Brigitte Bardot wrote an open letter to the President of Kazakhstan Kasym-Jomart Tokayev, in which she complained about the cruel treatment of animals in the country. She expressed her horror and despair over the fate of stray animals in Kazakhstan and offered a help of her Foundation to stop cruelty to dogs and cats.

(https://tengrinews.kz/world_news/brijit-bardo-pojalovalas-tokaevu-jestokoe-obraschenie-386681/).

In February 2020, The President officially responded to a Brigitte Bardot`s letter denouncing cruel methods of killing stray animals in his country. He also promised to her that a law had been drafted to improve the situation of stray animals (https://liter.kz/tokaev-otvetil-na-pismo-brizhit-bardo-obrativshejsya-s-prosboj-o-zashhite-zhivotnyh/).

Kazakhstan, Year 2022.

Up until now, ""no action on anything"" has been taken by the President.

To say the least, The Animal Control Departments do not obey “the 60-day period of keeping the caught animal safe” rule, and instead, they kill them within three days!

How can you explain your “all talk and no action"" attitude, Mr. Tokayev?

Your promises have become lies!

What can be done to stop cruelty against stray animals in Kazakhstan?

1. The President and the Government of Kazakhstan must pass the animal rights law.

2. The President must make the killing of defenceless animals illegal.

3. The President must adopt a humane animal population management programme through:

•   Neutering and vaccination programmes.

•  Development of the rehoming scheme.

• Suspension of killing centres until the legislation regarding animal rights has become law.

•   Animal welfare education to ensure unwanted animals are treated with kindness, respect and understanding.

What can YOU do to save animals in Kazakhstan?

Please do your part to help and save innocent animals!

We ask everyone who cares about dogs and cats of Kazakhstan:

1. SIGN THE PETITION!

2. SHARE THE PETITION ON YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA, EMAIL IT TO YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND ASK THEM TO SIGN IT!

BRING GLOBAL ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE!

3. WRITE AN APPEAL LETTERS TO THE KAZAKHSTAN CONSULATES/EMBASSIES IN YOUR COUNTRY AND DEMAND THEM TO:

-  pass animal welfare law,

- stop killing stray dogs and cats,

- ensure compliance with policies and procedures in Animal Control Centres,

-  carry out a thorough inspection of each Animal Control Centre in Kazakhstan and subject them to financial audits. If violations are found during an inspection, to initiate a criminal prosecution against the killing centers, bring criminal charges against those who authorizes unlawful killing of animals and steals funds allocated for the animals under their supervision,

- adopt a humane and effective management of dog and cat populations through using of a trap-neuter-vaccinate-return program,

-   suspend the Animal Control Centres until the legislation regarding animal rights has become law,

-  educate the citizen of Kazakhstan about responsibility and animal care.

Express YOUR opinions and attitude in writing:

about cruelty to, and unlawful killing of animals in Kazakhstan,

about disease-ridden conditions at Animal Control Centres,

about catching and killing domestic dogs and cats,

about mass shooting animals on the street, often in front of children.

Together we can make a difference!

People can protect themselves, but animals cannot.

The government is constantly pushing the use of public transport and there has been much debate about whether or not to permit dogs travelling on public transport.

While I understand there will be a lot of negative feedback regarding this issue there are many good points for it.

In Victoria dogs are allowed to travel on trains. Why not NSW?

Trains being one of the most popular and easiest modes of transport.

In NSW dogs are only allowed to travel at present on ferries with permission from staff before boarding. This does not include assistance dogs who are permitted to travel on all public transport.

Wouldn't it be great for all dog owners in NSW to have the privilege of traveling via train with their four legged best friends? Whether it be to the vet, a dog friendly park or beach.

It would reduce the amount of cars entering the NSW roads and promote a more active lifestyle with your pet.

My personal recommendations to get this subject legalised would be to have a carriage (the very last carriage would be ideal) that is dog friendly. Anyone can travel on it with their pet or the general public if they don't mind travelling with dogs. This way they're a far distance away from people with allergies to dogs and dog fur or people who just arn't fond of them in general.

If your dog is known to easily snap, growl or bite at anyone a muzzle would have to be worn.

You must be able to control your dog at all times.

Owners MUST clean up any mess left behind by their dog and at all times dogs MUST be on a leash.

If dog owners fail to abide by these rules a fine would definitely be advised.

Perhaps purchasing a ticket for your dog could be implemented to the state government gains something from this.

This would make it fair and complaint free for all.

With so many dog friendly facilities available around the state and many many events featuring these furry four legged friends, it would make things so much easier for dog owners to travel to them rather than being stuck in traffic and causing cars on the road.

If you agree with me please sign your name, send this petition to the state premier, prime minister, opposition leader or your local member of parliament.

Perhaps a one year trial run could be made to see how this would work out then make a decision from there.

So far in 2020, two bears have been killed in West Vancouver and three in North Vancouver.

We as humans have encroached on the territory of wildlife and are failing in our basic responsibilities for reducing attractants that teach a bear to forage in our garbage. There is zero excuse for the endangerment of the Black Bears we share this community with. After all, we moved into their home.

We are calling on the District of North Vancouver to immediately increase the minimum fine for contravention of the District’s Solid Waste Removal Bylaw from $100.00 to $500.00 with a zero tolerance policy.

As noted in the recommendations (page 5).

First, the provincial government should improve its internal policies for handling human-wildlife conflict to reflect a more restrained approach to using lethal force and a better understanding of the science of wildlife behaviour. Ideally, Cabinet would pass a regulation incorporating these guidelines in order to make them legally enforceable.

Second, the province should introduce independent oversight of the BCCOS.

""Given the amount of public criticism of BC conservation officers’ decisions to kill wildlife in recent years, a thorough review of BCCOS policies and operations is overdue.

'Better to get the death sentence': Pakistani family faces deportation over disability

Faisal Altaf and his family is facing an uncertain future after being told by the government that keeping their children here will “likely result in a significant cost to the Australian community”.

After spending eight years in Australia, Faisal Altaf, and his family have integrated fully into life in Melbourne.

Faisal works as a mechanic, his wife volunteers at a local community centre and two of his three children attend a special school.

Fourteen-year-old Maaz and 16-year-old Saim suffer from a rare condition known as Methylmalonic acidaemia - a metabolic disorder in which the body is unable to process certain proteins and fats.

However, after assessing the family’s application for permanent residency Faisal told SBS Urdu they were told by the Department of Home Affairs that their two sons “do not meet the health requirement” set out in Australian migration law.  It was estimated that the “potential cost to the Australian community” would be $7.3 million if the children were allowed to remain in Australia.

If Saim and Maaz’s applications for permanent residence are rejected, under the Australian migration law the whole family would then have to leave the country.

Faisal, who originally came to Australia as an international student, fears for his sons' treatment and safety if they are not allowed to remain in Australia.

“It’s better to get the death sentence than deport us,"" he told SBS Urdu.

""There is no treatment for my [my] kids in Pakistan. They would be bullied because of their disability and I fear for their security.”

Limited treatment is available in Pakistan for patients with metabolic disorders. However, only one facility - the  Agha Khan Hospital in Karachi - offers ongoing treatment.

“Centres in collaboration with Agha Khan University have opened up in major cities around the country which help with diagnosing patients suffering from metabolic disorders,” Dr Idrees Shani, a specialist in internal medicine from Faisalabad, told SBS Urdu.

“For the ongoing treatment of metabolic disorders patients will have to relocate to Karachi as none of the facilities is equipped for ongoing treatment,” he added.

For Faisal, originally from Rawalpindi in the country's north, relocating his family to the port city of Karachi in southern Pakistan in order for his sons to get the ongoing treatment they need would be difficult.

""My whole family is in Punjab. Moving to Karachi would be like relocating once again. I would have to get a house and find a job straight away. Whereas living in Rawalpindi I have extended family there. They can help me out with my family, house, job etc,"" he said.

The family has a strong presence in Melbourne's local community. Faisal founded a community group and now more than 20 people meet twice a week to play badminton.

Both sons also play cricket with a local club.

“Life in Australia has been great. We love it here. Over here I can earn enough and take care of my family,” he said.

His wife, Nadia, says she wanted to assimilate into society when she arrived in 2015 and therefore decided to volunteer at the local food bank twice a month.

“I wanted to have a social life and this was my way of giving back to the community,” she said.

The Public Interest Criterion (PIC) 4007 (1) (c) (ii) (a) of the Migration Regulations 1994 states if the applicant “results in a significant cost to the Australian community in the areas of health care and community services;”

This specific health criterion is under which both Saim and Maaz’s application was assessed and deemed as “not meeting the health requirement.”

Faisal Altaf said he was unaware of the specific disability before moving to Australia, and his children were only successfully diagnosed after coming to Australia.

He says he's glad they are finally getting treatment and emphasized that since moving to Australia not once have they required a carer for their kids.

“For the last four years we have been taking care of the kids without any additional cost or help from the government,” he said.

“I believe that the Altaf family will continue [their] positive contribution to our society if granted permanent residency,” - Peter Khalil MP

“My kids visit three doctors twice a year for their regular check-ups which cost about $64 per visit. Medicare currently pays for it but I am more than happy to fork out for this cost myself,” he added.

Users get much lower speed than what is claimed.There is a wide gap between 3G and 4G speed claims of ISPs and their actual performance.It was found that the maximum 4G speed among the sample was just 4.10 mbps and only 1.50 mbps in case of 3G, which is not even close to its definition. Quality of Internet Services (QoIS) significantly impacts the lives of the people and must therefore be improved. Based on this study, this petition calls upon Government of India and TRAI to take the following steps-

· For better quality of speed a Mandatory disclosure of min avg download speed be made, which must be met at least 95% of the times.· ISPs to include a speed measurement tool in their apps and maintain a record of average speed during the day, week and month.· ISPs to disclose minimum and maximum speeds on daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly basis. Compensate consumers for failing to adhere to average download speeds and down time. TRAI should create a mechanism for compensation for quantifiable losses below the benchmark.· Declare minimum speeds at the time of sale of plans.· TRAI’s MySpeed App should be made more robust and user-friendly. It should be able to provide speed comparisons for each BTS and also show comparisons of ISPs at given BTS.· Each ISP app must have a complaint feature with follow up of outcome of complaints.· TRAI should find a way so that consumer using internet can come to know the reduction in speed or loss of signal at a particular point of time.

While culture may be addressed in some general education courses, we feel that URI has a duty to directly address and educate students on racial issues. URI is made up of approximately 70% white students, compared to 5% black students. Studies have shown that black students often feel disconnected from their schools and peers, a disconnect that can be attributed to institutionalized racism. Black students can also experience “double consciousness”, in which black people are essentially forced to maintain two identities: who they actually are and how they are perceived by their non-black peers.

We need harsher laws preventing water pollution, violators should be faced with fines or maybe even imprisonment depending on the severity. People should be encouraged to recycle rainwater that they may have collected. We should begin to adopt agricultural practices that use less water. We should also contribute to funds to begin to reinstate water catchment areas and to support clean water incentives especially in areas that are currently or may face water shortage.

KAWA’s Petition in Korean

‘경북 상주 차량에 개를 묶어 끌고 다니다 죽게 한 학대 사건’ 엄중처벌 탄원 서명“시속 60~80km 되는 차량에 이끌려 살기 위해 달렸지만 결국 피투성이가 된 네 발로 죽음을 맞이한 빨간 발의 개”

승합차 유기견 학대 사건의 아픔과 분노가 여전한 가운데 차량을 이용한 참혹한 동물 학대 사건이 경북 상주에서 연이어 발생했습니다.

지난 7일, 갤로퍼 차량이 개의 목에 끈을 묶어 뒤편에 매단 채 시속 60~80킬로로 달리는 모습을 목격하여 해당 차량의 뒤를 쫓았고, 학대 차량이 지나간 길에는 피가 흥건한 것을 목격했다고 합니다. 차량이 잠시 정차한 틈을 타 자세히 확인해보니 개는 네 발이 모두 뭉개져 보랏빛피투성이가 되어 있었으며 차량에 끌려다녔던 개는 당시 이미 죽은 것인지 미동조차 없는 처참한 상태였습니다.

차량 블랙박스 영상 속 개의 몸통에는 특별히 외상이 없었으나 네 다리는 피투성이가 되어 있었습니다. 이는 학대자가 살아 있는 개를 차에 묶어 달렸고, 목이 묶인 개는 차량 속도를 따라잡으려 죽을힘을 다해 달리다가 결국 사망한 것으로 추정됩니다. 이것은 ‘노상에서 잔인한 방식으로 동물을 죽음에 이르게 한 명백한 동물학대 사건’입니다.

시민 여러분, 차량 운전자 즉 학대자는 생명의 존엄성에 대한 인식이 전혀 존재하지 않았습니다. 과연 자신의 소중한 개라면 이렇게까지 할 수 있었을까요? 개의 상태를 단 한 번이라도 확인해 봤다면 이런 안타깝게 죽음에 이르게 하지도 않았을 것입니다. 자유롭게 뛰어놀아야 할 개는 억지로 목이 묶여 살기 위해 뛰었습니다. 빨간 발의 개는 숨이 찰 때까지 뛰고 또 뛰었지만, 마음처럼 따라주지 않는 피로 흥건한 발이 원망스러웠을 겁니다. 빨간 발이 된 개의 죽음이 헛되지 않도록 여러분들께서 동물자유연대와 함께 목소리를 높여주시고, 학대자가 저지른 죄에 대한 응당한 대가를 치를 수 있도록 탄원 서명에 함께 동참해주시길 간곡히 부탁드립니다.

이 서명은 사건 수사를 담당할 상주경찰서 및 대구지검 상주지청에 철저한 수사와 엄중처벌을 촉구하기 위해 제출할 예정입니다.

We as residents of Coven, request the bus service to be reinstated to allow locals that have no access to any other vehicles, the opportunity to travel locally.

This is an important life line. No bus service increases isolation. Many residents will feel secluded and unable to maintain or achieve many opportunities that are not available within the local community of Coven Village.  This change has affected retirees, students and commuters alike.

To avoid deprivation and social impact we feel that no adequate assesment had taken place to assess the much needed support of this vital service within Coven.

Some of the biggest and most easily fixed problems on Facebook are frequent spam, stolen content and privacy concerns. Facebook and the offenders using it keep getting get away with these things all because it makes them more money due to ad revenue.

Spam, something Facebook is full of is seen everywhere on people’s feeds you will see posts like “Like and Share = 1 prayer for this poor child”, things like this are just trying to trick users into giving it free promotion. Things like this should be filtered out, removed and have penalty’s to stop culprits from doing it again.

Stolen content. Some of the top pages on Facebook steal videos and content from other websites like YouTube. Videos uploaded on YouTube go through a Content ID Check, this is where the video is automatically searched for any copyright content. On Facebook, this isn't the same, videos are uploaded and go through no check. If the user puts ads on the video both the user and Facebook make money. Facebook rarely takes down stolen content and even when they do, the user keeps the ad revenue and so does Facebook. The user is also let off lightly and most likely just does it again. But there is a more serious concern that Facebook needs to attend to.

Privacy, something we all want to have. Facebook is watching you, and what you do, they watch your searches, use your personal information and some people have had suspicions about their microphone audio being recorded without permission. These are all things that benefit Facebook by helping them serve different ads based on what you talk about and look at, all this information is saved by Facebook. I think that Facebook forgets that we are people and not just money making machines, we need to know what data is being stored about us and we need the option to stop it being recorded as well as knowing what our data is used for.

You can have a look at original content creators below for more information:

There is no legal recourse for victims of racial discrimination in South Korea, nor, for example, is there any bill that protects the LGBT community.  Ethnic Koreans make up about 96% of the population, making it one of the least diverse countries in the world.  However, as the need to employ foreign workers arises, and as foreign interest in South Korean fashion, cosmetics and cinema grows, it is inevitable that more and more people would want to explore opportunities in Korea. On a personal level, I have lived, studied and worked in South Korea for over two years and I have experienced racism myself, but my experiences are nothing when compared to that of many others, such as people from South East Asian countries, people of color, people who have some weight on their bodies and so on.  Despite the racist attitudes toward foreigners as well as the degrading and inhumane treatment of foreign migrant workers, racism is the norm here — not the exception. Many people have walked away from Korea telling their stories of shock and horror, and you can find their stories on Youtube, on personal blogs, and elsewhere online.  However, those stories would most likely come from English teachers, spouses of Koreans, or fans of k-drama or k-pop, but what we don’t hear are the stories of those migrant workers, undocumented migrants, refugees, and the victims of abuse, because for one reason or another they are neglected in the process. While no one can deny what the South Koreans have endured as a people, and what blood, sweat and tears they have shed to build this wonderful country, racial discrimination should not serve as an excuse for self-preservation in the 21st century. A quick search on the internet, and it reveals that nearly all non-Koreans living in Seoul have experienced discrimination based on their nationality, appearance, or level of education, according to a 2015 survey. We therefore demand that South Korea enact anti-discrimination laws to end rampant abuse of migrant agricultural workers, abuse and exploitation such as unfair dismissal, sexual assault of women migrant workers, racial profiling of Muslim persons, different treatment toward mixed or ‘half-caste’ persons, discrimination based on nationality, color, religion, including ‘no-foreigners allowed’ policy etc. The bottom line is: due to lack of anti-discrimination laws, and a way to teach against racism, some Koreans, in particular businesses can abuse, exploit and discriminate against the foreign workers in South Korea. It is racist, unfair, out of date, and MUST STOP."

La possibilité de prendre des photos dans les lieux publics est gravement menacée. Jusqu'à présent, dans la plupart des pays européens vous pouvez prendre et publier des photos prises depuis des lieux publics sans aucun risque - cela s'appelle la liberté de Panorama. En vacances, vous pouvez prendre une photo du London Eye et la partager avec vos amis sur Facebook *. Si quelqu'un veut vous payer pour l'utilisation de cette photo, c'est aussi possible. Mais cela est en train de changer et la photographie telle que nous la connaissons pourrait disparaître.

Julia Reda, membre du Parlement européen, a essayé d'étendre la liberté de Panorama à tous les pays de l'UE, dans la mesure où quelques pays comme la France et l'Italie ne sont pas encore dotés d'une telle loi. Dans la majorité des pays tels que le Royaume-Uni, l'Espagne, le Portugal, l'Allemagne, les Pays-Bas, la Pologne, la République tchèque, la Slovaquie, la Hongrie, l'Autriche et la Croatie, vous pouvez, sans aucun risque, prendre, publier et vendre des photos de lieux ou monuments publics lorsqu'elles sont prises depuis des espaces publics.

Cependant, le projet de loi actuel renverse totalement la proposition. Au lieu d'apporter la liberté de Panorama aux quelques pays qui ne connaissent pas encore cette loi, il la retirerait à tous les pays déjà dotés de ce texte. Si ce projet est adopté, nous dirions au revoir aux photos de rue, de voyages et d'architecture telles que nous les connaissons. Il est impossible de connaître l'architecte de chaque bâtiment public afin de lui demander la permission avant de pouvoir publier et éventuellement vendre la photo.

Je demande donc aux membres du Parlement européen de:

- ne limiter la liberté de Panorama en aucune manièreet au contraire :

- d'apporter la liberté Panorama à tous les Etats membres de l'UE

de sorte que les citoyens européens puissent être assurés d'agir en toute légalité lorsqu’ils photographient et publient des photos de bâtiments publics partout dans l'Union européenne. Cela est nécessaire pour célébrer les cultures et l’art européens !

* Comme Julia Reda, membre du Parlement européen, le souligne, même le téléchargement privé d'une photo sur Facebook nécessiterait le consentement de l'architecte, puisqu’avec le téléchargement vous accordez à Facebook une licence pour utiliser commercialement la photographie.

En tant que photographe de voyages, je tente de capter les plus beaux paysages du monde dans la meilleure lumière, pour donner envie au plus grand nombre de commencer à voyager et d'explorer les cultures. Ce ne serait pas possible sans la liberté de Panorama. Depuis que je travaille en tant que photographe partout en Europe, je connais aussi les inconvénients de la loi sur le droit d'auteur qui n'est pas encore complètement harmonisée dans l'Union européenne. Pour protéger les droits des photographes, j'ai lancé PhotoClaim, un service qui aide les photographes à faire valoir leurs droits dans les autres pays européens. La photographie comme art doit pouvoir capturer la beauté et la culture du monde, sans que le photographe craigne d'enfreindre la loi."

95,Keep Farm Animal Rescue Open for Visitors,"Farm Animal Rescue is a registered charity and sanctuary for animals that have been rescued from Farm Animal Rescue unless we spend $300,000 adding an additional lane to Dayboro Road, a highway","['Jackie Trad', 'Steven Miles']",Brad King,"Dayboro, Australia",43070,"Jul 11, 2017",https://assets.change.org/photos/1/nl/tp/qNNltPnsqEOCtkg-800x450-noPad.jpg?1509313862,"Farm Animal Rescue is a registered charity and sanctuary for animals that have been rescued from starvation, danger and abuse.

The Queensland Government has made the decision to ban visitors from Farm Animal Rescue unless we spend $300,000 adding an additional lane to Dayboro Road, a highway managed by Queensland Transport and Main Roads.

Our supporters donate to the charity to help animals, not so that we can improve the states' highway infrastructure. Regardless of this, we don't have $300,000 to spend. In fact this is much more than we make from donations and contributions each year.

The Queensland Government are requiring this action because of ""safety"". On average we have one visitor vehicle arrive at the farm each day. This is opposed to some of our neighbours who receive up to 400 visitor vehicles per day, including heavy vehicles, and do not have an additional lane on the highway outside their premises.

In fact we have been told that even with zero increased visitor volume, we would be required to carry out construction of the highway just to be able to avoid a visitor ban.

While we have total confidence in our current supporters staying with us, it is not feasible for us to maintain the sanctuary if we are forced to tell new supporters that they cannot see our work. Our financial projections show that ultimately this requirement will cause the sanctuary to close.

We ask that Jackie Trad, Deputy Premier and Minister for Transport and Planning, instruct her team to find a way that we can maintain some visitor access to the sanctuary without the need to develop the State's highway infrastructure.

97,Support conservation of Bukit Batok Hillside Park area to ensure a sustainable future,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMfX8xK8fE&feature=youtu.be
What is the issue?
The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has engaged an environmental consultancy firm to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) on Bukit Batok Hillside Park in the western region of Singapore, in view of planned housing development.
Why is this issue of great concern to you?
While I commend HDB for initiating the environmental study in their proposal to build more housing units, I have several concerns about the potential impacts of deforestation in Bukit Batok Hillside Park:

Loss of biodiversity and natural heritage
Risk of soil erosion and landslides
Loss of natural cooling effect and increase in urban heat effect
Loss of cultural and historical heritage
Loss of connection to Nature and increase in stress and anxiety associated with urban claustrophobia
Increase in dengue fever cases due to conditions favouring increased reproduction of disease-carrying mosquitoes

(Click here for the full details of the above concerns, which include perspectives on our public health, population growth trend and so on.)
For a summary of Bukit Batok Hillside Park Proposed Developments EIA feedback gathered by Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity (SYVB), click here.
How can you help?
By signing the petition and sharing it with others, you can help to:

add your voice to let HDB (and other relevant authorities) know that you are concerned about ensuring a sustainable future for ourselves and our future generations.
create awareness for more people about the need to conserve our fast-dwindling forested areas, which serve as a home for our flora and fauna, which we are all interdependent on
ensure that we will not let another natural habitat disappear under our nose, and hopefully prevent future cases of deforestation and their negative consequences from happening
advocate the need for creative solutions, such as considering brownfield sites and underutilized lands (such as golf courses, abandoned buildings awaiting redevelopment, etc), as alternatives for housing development instead of sacrificing our endangered natural habitats.

In out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, quick action by bystanders, namely, the administration of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), is critical and can triple the victim’s chances of survival, raising it from approximately 4% to 10%. If bystanders apply and administer a shock with an Automated External Defibrillator (AED), a device that is located in many businesses and public places, that survival rate can increase to approximately 38%. Even in situations where bystander CPR is performed, this CPR must be performed as efficiently and properly as possible; CPR only provides the brain with 30% of its normal blood flow, and thus, any loss to this already small percentage due to improper CPR has a significant impact on survival rates. Thus, proper CPR training that emphasizes quick action, high-quality compressions, and early defibrillation is key to raising OHCA survival rates.

Women are 29% less likely than men to survive an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and 27% less likely than men to receive bystander CPR in the first place, when location type, age, and race were controlled for. This different response stems from several reasons, including fear of causing further injury to a woman, belief that women do not need CPR, fear of being accused of inappropriately touching the victim, and a reluctance to unclothe a woman in public, as proper CPR and AED administration requires the patient to have a naked torso.

Currently, CPR classes require practicing compressions and AEDs on male, flat-chested manikins. Furthermore, there is not adequate representation of non-male individuals in the modules. Every five years the American Heart Association revises its guidelines for its CPR/AED classes, and the next revision will take place in 2025. Our hope is to obtain enough signatures on this petition to convince the AHA to adjust its class requirements to include greater representation of non-male individuals, specifically females. Sign and join the change to reduce the gender gap in CPR/AED!

Together We Fight to End Impunity: Justice for Victims of State-Backed Killings in Cambodia

More than forty years have passed since the fall of the Khmer Rouge Regime, yet extrajudicial killings have continuously been widely committed. The Hun Sen’s regime in Cambodia still uses unjust methods to silence political opponents and adversaries. No independent legal investigations for these killings that involve Hun Sen have been conducted. Hun Sen’s partisan politics dictate wide inequitable political and social actions in Cambodia, preventing Cambodian justice from materializing.

End Impunity in Cambodia campaign will mount a ""take Hun Sen and his allies to an independent Justice system"" referendum petition both online and directly with Cambodian communities inside and outside of the country and non-Cambodians with the aim of gaining 500,000 signatures that will be sent with case reports of each victim murdered by the Hun Sen regime since the signing of the Paris Peace Accords.

The case reports of each victim will be complied into a White Paper that will serve as material for public information, education, advocacy and to reveal the truth that the regime of Hun Sen has attempted to hide.

We demand justice through independent investigations of these killings. There will be no real peace until we create an end to impunity together.

We will advocate for the signatories of the Paris Peace Accords to impose visa sanctions and the freezing of assets of Hun Sen and those directly implicated in the extra judicial killings.

To do this, commemoration ceremonies will be held on July 10, 2020, in Cambodian communities around the world, centered around the fourth anniversary of Dr. Kem Ley’s assassination in Phnom Penh on July 10, 2016.

Dr. Kem Ley was a Cambodian activist, physician, and political commentator, known for his political commentary, especially on the Cambodian People's Party. Throughout his lifetime he was a researcher on HIV and AIDS with the UNDP, UNICEF, and USAID as well as a political writer and activist. Most of all, he was well-loved by many Cambodians. In a politically motivated assassination, Dr. Kem Ley was fatally shot on July 10th. Dr. Kem Ley’s assassination was devastating for Cambodian communities and condemned domestically and internationally.

The July 10 commemoration ceremonies will also mark the launch of “We Never Forgot You - Ending Impunity in Cambodia”, a worldwide campaign to find justice for:● Piset Pilika, a renown ballet dancer and actress murdered on 6 July 1999● Chea Vichea, the first trade union leader, assassinated on 22 January 2004● Chut Wutty, a fearless environmentalist murdered on 26 April 2012

We will also pay respects to the spirits of journalists, activists, military men, trade union leaders, politicians, students, innocent citizens and workers murdered since the signing of the Paris Peace Accords on 23 October 1991.

Together We Fight to End Impunity: Justice for Victims of State-Backed Killings in Cambodia, will engage Cambodians and international figures with knowledge of state-killings in Cambodia to form a movement that will seek to evoke unified condemnations against the brutality of the Hun Sen’s regime and to bring the main perpetrators to justice.

We wish to focus the ceremony on Dr. Kem Ley’s tragic assassination, commemorating it as the main event, so Cambodians inside and outside Cambodia can express their mourning on the cruelty committed under the current dictatorial regime.

By accepting to be complacent to the fake democracy under the regime of Hun Sen, the signatories of the Paris Peace Accords fail to fulfill their obligations to the people of Cambodia who deserve true peace.

Ensemble, nous luttons pour mettre fin à l'impunité: Justice pour les victimes de meurtres soutenus par l'État au Cambodge

Plus de quarante ans se sont écoulés depuis la chute du régime khmer rouge, mais des exécutions extrajudiciaires n'ont cessé d'être largement commises. Le régime de Hun Sen au Cambodge utilise encore des méthodes injustes pour faire taire les opposants politiques et les adversaires. Aucune enquête judiciaire indépendante pour ces tueries qui impliquent Hun Sen ont été menées. La politique partisane de Hun Sen dicte de vastes actions politiques et sociales inéquitables au Cambodge, empêchant la justice cambodgienne de se matérialiser.

La campagne de «Mettre fin à l'impunité pour la justice au Cambodge» organisera une pétition << Emmenez Hun Sen vers un système de justice indépendant >> à la fois en ligne et directement avec les communautés cambodgiennes à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur du pays et pour les non-Cambodgiens dans le but de gagner 500 000 signatures qui seront envoyées avec les rapports de cas de chaque victime assassinée par le régime de Hun Sen depuis la signature des accords de paix de Paris.

Le rapport de cas de chaque victime sera consigné dans un livre blanc qui servira de matériel d'information publique, d'éducation, de plaidoyer et de révélation de la vérité que le régime de Hun Sen a tenté de cacher.

Nous demandons justice par le biais d'enquêtes indépendantes sur ces homicides. Il n'y aura pas de paix véritable tant que nous n'aurons pas mis fin ensemble à l'impunité.

Nous plaiderons pour que les signataires des accords de paix de Paris imposent des sanctions de visa et le gel des avoirs de Hun Sen et de ceux directement impliqués dans les exécutions extrajudiciaires.

Des cérémonies de commémoration aura lieu le 10 juillet 2020 dans les communautés cambodgiennes du monde entier, autour du quatrième anniversaire de l'assassinat de Kem Ley à Phnom Penh le 10 juillet 2016.

Dr. Kim Ley était un activiste, médecin et critique politique cambodgien, connu pour ses commentaires politiques, en particulier sur le Parti du peuple cambodgien. Tout au long de sa vie, il a été chercheur sur le VIH et le SIDA auprès du PNUD, de l'UNICEF et de l'USAID, ainsi qu'un écrivain politique et activiste. Surtout, il était apprécié de nombreux Cambodgiens. Dans un assassinat à motivation politique, Ley a été tué par balle le 10 juillet. L’assassinat de Kem Ley a été dévastateur pour les communautés cambodgiennes et a été condamné aux niveaux national et international.

Les cérémonies de commémoration du 10 juillet marqueront également le lancement de « Nous ne vous avons jamais oublié - Mettre fin à l'impunité au Cambodge», une campagne mondiale visant à obtenir justice pour:

• Piset Pilika, danseuse de ballet et actrice de renom assassinée le 6 juillet 1999• Chea Vichea, le premier dirigeant syndical, assassiné le 22 janvier 2004• Chut Wutty, un environnementaliste intrépide assassiné le 26 avril 2012

Nous rendrons également hommage à l'esprit des journalistes, des militants, des militaires, des dirigeants syndicaux, des politiciens, des étudiants, des citoyens et des travailleurs innocents assassinés depuis la signature des accords de paix de Paris le 23 octobre 1991.

Ensemble, nous luttons pour mettre fin à l'impunité: la justice pour les victimes de meurtres soutenus par l'État au Cambodge engagera des Cambodgiens et des personnalités internationales ayant connaissance des assassinats d'État au Cambodge pour former un mouvement qui cherchera à susciter des condamnations unifiées contre la brutalité du régime de Hun Sen et de traduire les principaux coupables en justice.

Nous avons choisi l'assassinat tragique de Dr. Kem Ley comme l’événement principal afin que les Cambodgiens à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur du Cambodge puissent commémorer et exprimer leur deuil sur la cruauté commise sous le régime dictatorial actuel.

En acceptant d'être complaisants envers la fausse démocratie sous le régime de Hun Sen, les signataires des accords de paix de Paris manquent à leurs obligations envers le peuple du Cambodge qui mérite une vraie paix."

Questa petizione deriva da una proposta di dichiarazione di emergenza climatica europea redatta ad aprile 2019 da Dario Tamburrano, ambientalista ed eurodeputato della legislatura 2014-2019. Noi di Clessidre Climatiche la rilanciamo nella speranza che sia presa in esame e adottata dal nuovo Parlamento Europeo, riteniamo che sulla questione climatica si possa, e si debba dare, un segnale forte e di unità dell’intero continente non solo a livello simbolico, ma soprattutto di cambio di rotta e azioni reali. Ringraziamo Dario Tamburrano per averci ispirato.

Il Parlamento europeo,

- vista la Convenzione quadro delle Nazioni Unite sui cambiamenti climatici (UNFCCC) e il protocollo di Kyoto;

- visto l'accordo di Parigi, decisione 1/CP.21, della 21a conferenza delle parti (COP21) dell'UNFCCC e della conferenza delle parti che fungono da riunione delle parti del protocollo di Kyoto (CMP11 ), tenutesi a Parigi, in Francia, dal 30 novembre all'11 dicembre 2015;

- vista la 24a conferenza delle parti (COP24) dell'UNFCCC, la 14a sessione della riunione delle parti del protocollo di Kyoto (CMP14) e la terza parte della prima sessione della conferenza delle parti in servizio come riunione delle parti dell'accordo di Parigi (CMA1.3), tenutesi a Katowice, in Polonia, dal 2 al 14 dicembre 2018;

- visto il rapporto speciale del Gruppo intergovernativo sui cambiamenti climatici (IPCC) ""Global Warming of 1.5°C"", la sua quinta relazione di valutazione (AR5) e la sua relazione di sintesi,

A. Sottolineando che il cambiamento climatico è un'emergenza globale, come confermato dalla stragrande maggioranza della comunità scientifica;

B. Considerando che il cambiamento climatico è oggetto del più grande accordo intergovernativo mai firmato in materia;

C. Sottolineando la crescente preoccupazione dei cittadini europei per i cambiamenti climatici, come dimostrato da numerosi sondaggi, dichiarazioni, manifestazioni e azioni dimostrative;

D. Ricordando che molti livelli di governo, dai piccoli comuni ai parlamenti nazionali, stanno dichiarando l'emergenza climatica, come per esempio i parlamenti di Irlanda e Regno Unito hanno recentemente adottato una mozione che impegna i rispettivi governi a dichiarare lo stato di emergenza climatica e ad agire su di essa con misure concrete e proposte legislative nei prossimi mesi;

1-Si sollecita a non ritardare ulteriormente l'adozione di un Patto europeo per l'emergenza climatica, impegnando gli Stati membri e i paesi limitrofi a raggiungere emissioni nette zero di gas a effetto serra preferibilmente entro il 2030 o comunque prima del 2050;   2-Si esorta a stilare tale patto (analogamente al Patto di bilancio europeo e al Patto di stabilità e crescita) con norme vincolanti che coinvolgano, la Commissione europea, gli Stati membri e i paesi vicini per almeno:

1) Eliminare qualsiasi tipo di sussidio, diretto o indiretto, ai combustibili fossili, che gravano con 300 miliardi di euro all'anno in tutta l'Unione Europea;

2) Ridurre sensibilmente l'IVA sulle fonti di energia rinnovabile, in modo da ridurre ulteriormente il loro costo / prezzo - già ora sostanzialmente pari a quello delle energie tradizionali. Impiegare della tassazione residua sulle energie rinnovabili per dare supporto ai consumatori vulnerabili e per combattere la povertà energetica;

3) Ridurre al minimo l'IVA sui prodotti a basse emissioni, rendendoli più convenienti al consumatore finale;

4) Premiare le aziende che producono beni e servizi a basse emissioni di carbonio e rispondenti ai principi di circolarità; incentivare e supportare quelle aziende che desiderano migliorare i propri processi produttivi in direzione più rispettosa dell'ambiente;

5) Introdurre il concetto di emergenza climatica nelle legislazioni nazionali degli Stati membri;

6) Abolire i vincoli di bilancio, il famoso 3%, per tutti gli investimenti pubblici che abbiano il fine di ridurre le emissioni di CO2;

7) Introdurre una Carbon tax.

******ENGLISH TEXT******

Petition for the European declaration of climate emergency

This petition derives from a proposal for a European climate emergency declaration drafted in April 2019 by Dario Tamburrano, environmentalist and MEP for the 2014-2019 legislature. We are relaunching it in the hope that it will be examined and adopted by the new European Parliament. We believe that on the climate issue we can and should give a strong signal of unity for the entire continent, not only on a symbolic level but above all on a change of route and real actions. We thank Dario Tamburrano for having inspired us.

The European Parliament,– having regard to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol thereto,

–​having regard to the Paris Agreement, Decision 1/CP.21, to the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the UNFCCC and to the 11th Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP11), held in Paris, France from 30 November to 11 December 2015,

–​having regard to the 24th Conference of the Parties (COP24) to the UNFCCC, the 14th session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP14), and the third part of the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA1.3), held in Katowice, Poland, from 2 to 14 December 2018,

–​having regard to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report entitled ‘Global Warming of 1.5°C’, its fifth assessment report (AR5) and its synthesis report,

A. Highlighting that climate change is a global emergency as confirmed by the vast majority of the scientific community;

B. Considering that climate change is the object of the biggest Intergovernmental Agreement ever signed on the matter;

C. Highlighting the majority of European citizens growing concern over climate change as showed by many surveys, declarations, manifestations, and demonstrative actions;

D. Recalling that many level of governments, from small municipalities to national parliaments are declaring the climate emergency, for instance the Parliaments of Ireland and United Kingdom have recently adopted a motion that engages the respective governments to declare the state of climate emergency and to act upon it with concrete measures and legislative proposals in the following months;

Urges not to delay any further the adoption of a European Pact for Climate Emergency, committing the Member States and of neighbouring countries to reach net-zero GHG emissions preferably by 2030 or in any case way before 2050;Urges to build such a Pact (similarly to the European Budget Pact and the Stability and Growth Pact) on binding  rules engaging the European Commission, the Member States and the nearby countries to at least:1) Eliminate any kind of subsidies, either direct or indirect, to fossil fuels, that worth 300 billion euros per year in all the EU;

2) Sensibly reduce the VAT on renewable energies sources, as to reduce even further their  cost/price – already now basically the same as the one on traditional energies. Employ the remaining taxation applied on  renewable energies for supporting vulnerable consumers and to fight energy poverty;

3) Minimise the VAT on low emission products, making them more convenient to the final consumer;

4) Reward the companies producing goods and services with low carbon emission and responding to circularity principles; incentivise and support those companies willing to improve their production processes towards a more environmentally friendly one;

5) Introduce the concept of climate emergency in the national legislations of  Member States;

6) Abolish the budgetary constraints, the famous 3%, for all the public investments in order to reduce the CO2 emissions;

7) Introduce a Carbon tax.

Le 8 Mars 2019, mon petit frère de 17 ans rentrait des cours lorsqu'il aperçoit un voisin, couteau à la main et sanguinolant, attendre près de notre portail. Il intercepta mon petit frère en lui expliquant que notre chien l'avait attaqué, qu'il l'a donc ""tué"".

Mon frère se précipita dans notre jardin et trouva notre chien, Jack, la gorge tranchée, se vidant de son sang mais toujours vivant, on pouvait même apercevoir sa trachée !!! Le jardin était une véritable boucherie, il y avait énormément de traces de sang.Il contacta immédiatement mon grand frère qui vint aussitôt, enroula la gorge du chien dans son blouson et le transporta immédiatement chez le vétérinaire qui ne pouvait rien faire. Le chien est donc euthanasié, sa souffrance étant trop grande.

Après le transport du chien, le voisin contacta la police et les pompiers. Après un examen des pompiers, il n'était pas nécessaire de le prendre en charge, n'ayant aucune blessure ou trace de morsure. Cependant, il attestait avoir fait cela car il s'était fait attaqué !!!

Selon le témoignage des voisins et de mon petit frère, l'homme possédait un couteau associé à un poing américain, permettant ainsi une bonne prise. Ce n'était donc pas une arme blanche anodine.

Notre malinois était un jeune chien très joueur, agréable et très intelligent. Nous l'avions amené à des séances de dressage. Ainsi, il était bien éduqué. S'il avait réellement attaqué l'homme, les blessures auraient été graves. De plus, il était très apprécié des enfants de notre entourage et ceux du lotissement, qui attestent n'avoir eu aucune appréhension de laisser leurs enfants jouer avec le chien.

Je tiens à préciser que le voisin habite à plusieurs maisons de la notre, que nous ne le connaissions pas et ne l'avions croisés que très rarement voire jamais pour certains membres de la famille.

Le Dimanche 15 Mars, nous avons reçu un coup de fil indiquant que le voisin est relâché pour légitime défense et que si des représailles se produiraient, nous serions les premiers accusés.

Le bilan des comptes est celui-ci: nous avons perdu notre chien, sauvagement assassiné, sommes traumatisés par la scène d'horreur dans notre jardin, avons du nettoyer le sang et, par dessus tout, croiser le meurtrier de notre chien dans le lotissement promener SON PROPRE CHIEN.

Nous sommes attristés et traumatisés, la justice n'a pas été capable d'être juste, j'en fais donc appel aux cœurs des humains, et souhaite que cet homme soit jugé pour ce qu'il a fait.

Below is the Fathers words about what happened.

“Westwood Middle School has been given a 24hr notice to correct this issue the right way, before I rain hell on them! This is the 3rd time that my son has been PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED under your watch. AND IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. Im not one of those soft ass parents, I will go to jail or the grave before I sit by and let this happen. Each time has also been verified by other students that my son was either defending another student, or was not the originator of the altercation. This time has been the real icing on the cake. A group of kids cornered my son in the pool during gym calls, splashed him and assaulted to the point of busting a blood vessel in his eye, giving him a black eye and almost drowning him. He went and told the PE coach, and his response was to “Stay away from them”. THEEEEN he was called into the deans office the next day and made to APOLOGIZE to the kids SO THAT THEY DO NOT JUMP HIM! I have been very nice and cordial through this ordeal and given them ample opportunities to rectify this situation properly. Well today, they were introduced to a section of me that I have closed off for a long time now. Let’s get this straight, I’m not a delusional parent, I KNOW my son is no star student, I know he cusses (if you think your middle school child doesn’t cuss, your stupid, also, he NEVER does it around me), and I know he is a pain in the ass. But they have found no proof, evidence, or testimony that he has done any harm to anyone. It is mandated by the state that my son be present at your facility. Which means that parents mandate that children are protected while there. While he is there I hold the staff personally responsible for my sons well being. If something happens to my son on your time, it’s your fault, and you need to rectify it. If you don’t rectify it and I let you get away with it, then it becomes my fault. I’ll be damned if I watch a video of my son getting jumped in the locker room on social media. They removed me from campus today because I used my words like a big boy and they felt the campus was not safe while I was there, so I removed my son from the campus bc I feel he is no longer safe without me there. I told the principal in front of everyone, “maybe if you kicked kids of campus for physical violence they way you kick a parent off campus for using his words, then you wouldn’t have these issues anymore”. Everyone of the children that have physically assaulted my son, still attend the campus. Why don’t schools deal with this shit like they used to? Ladies and gentlemen THIS is the problem with our world today. There is no discipline in today’s world. No consequences for actions. Funny thing is, I can probably be arrested for this post, but these people can still roam around campus intimidating my son. NOT ON MY WATCH!”

Like most people, our current director, Sara Garza, is unable to stay in a position that does not provide a living wage and basic benefits such as health insurance. For this reason, she has tendered her resignation effective at the end of the academic year.

The role of a Choir Director is complex.  Not only must directors be capable of directing a choir and accompanying musicians, they must select musical programs that will simultaneously train young students and excite them about music. They frequently serve their students as more than teachers, but as counselors, mentors, and trusted adults.  Unlike other high school positions, Choir Directors build lasting relationships with their students, providing them with structure and support they frequently lack but desperately need.  In addition, they work tirelessly with other staff members and volunteers to create after-school programming that benefit the school and the community. A performing arts program takes a village, and that village is led by the Choir Director.

While our administration will hopefully attempt to fill the position, finding a qualified candidate willing to take a role which is part-time in pay yet full-time in responsibility will be difficult to impossible. As such, there is a strong likelihood that the position will remain unfilled, and our choral music program will come to an end this year.  Along with the loss of the choral program, we will lose the ability to put on a spring musical, thereby affecting our theater, tech theater, and orchestral departments as well, not to mention the detrimental loss it would have on our community as a whole.

Our children are struggling right now as we continue to fight through a pandemic that has severely disrupted their social fabric and support network.  Now, more than ever, they need positivity and community.  The Music Program brings them that. Yet, the decision to decimate the program at EHS was made unilaterally, without input from the School Accountability Committee, parents, or parent organizations such as the PTSA.  It negatively impacts all of our students, many of them significantly. Likewise, it affects our community as a whole by limiting our exposure to the performing arts and taking away a critical support network for our children.

By signing this petition, you are letting Jefferson County Schools, Principal Brandon Brekke, and the EHS administration know that our community values the performing arts and the positive effect they have on our students and our community. We will not stand idly by while our program is destroyed.  With our voice, we can keep our performing arts intact and continue to provide out students with the excellent education they deserve."

We will still celebrate Emsie's birthday, with all those who loved her, and her gorgeous son who only had his mummy for 6 short months.

Emma had been under the care of the local Mental Health ‘Crisis Team’ for months before she died. This was not specialist peri-natal mental health care, but general ‘crisis’ mental health care. No one in that team was experienced enough in peri-natal care to understand or recognise how unwell Emma really was. Emma kept trying to tell them, so did her GP and so did we, her family. The Crisis Team was all Emma had – there was nowhere else for her to go for help.

The day before my sister died she repeatedly said to the Crisis Team that “I’m not safe” and that she was experiencing incessant thoughts of being dead. Emma discussed hospital admission with the Crisis team on this day, Emma should not have been given the option, the decision should have been made for her, and it is likely that she would not have died. We didn't know about this request or her plans, but we did know she needed help. We had asked for Emsie to be treated in a special mother and baby unit but the nearest one wasn't in her health trust area - so she couldn't use it.

Despite the shocking findings, I don't believe anything has changed Women suffering from postnatal depression are still not getting the care they need. That's why I've started this petition calling for NHS England, who have the responsibility to commission care postnatal care, to urgently review the situation. Please help me by signing here.

One in ten mothers experience some kind of postnatal depression. But research by the National Childbirth Trust has found only 50 out of 193 NHS trusts in England provide a specialist mental health service to women when they give birth.[1] With nearly 700,000 live births in England and Wales last year, this means of an estimated 70,000 women suffering from postnatal depression, only about 25% would have had access to the specialist care they need. This equates to 52,500 mothers a year being denied access to the specialist mental health care they need. [2]

Our case has revealed that if Emma had been referred to for specialist care she would have recovered. As a family we now have to live with the devastating consequences of this lack of care. No child should be without his mother because of an illness which is treatable.

Simon Stevens the CEO of NHS England has the power to instigate a review of the care provided for women and to commission new services where there are none. He can help make sure no other family have to suffer in this way.

Charities have started to speak out about the lack of care for postnatal depression. Now we must show NHS England that it is something people across the country are worried about.

Please help make sure no other mother is left without care by signing my petition for an urgent review.

See the official government gazetted notice to extend commentary.

1. DRAFT WHITE PAPER ON THE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF SOUTH AFRICA'S BIODIVERSITY

The South African government has set out a much needed, progressive vision and policy for conservation on the ethic of Ubuntu and the recognition that humanity can only flourish in the long-term by conserving the natural systems that support all life, and finding ways to coexist in harmony with Nature.

The EMS Foundation and the Wild Law Institute believe that in the past the effectiveness of conservation and environmental protection has been undermined by the anthropocentric and colonial misperception and hierarchical logic that humanity is in competition with Nature and that a balance must be struck between what is best for Nature on the one hand and what is best for humanity on the the other.  In fact, because humans are part of Nature, and human wellbeing is entirely dependent on the function of ecosystems, including wild species, protecting Nature is in the bet interests of humanity.

Conservation policies and decision must therefore be guided primarily by ecological and welfare considerations rather than economic considerations. Continuing to make conservation decisions on the basis of economic considerations will inevitably drive more ecological destruction and biodiversity loss. Human well being, and South Africa's long term economic interests, are best served by conserving wild species and ecosystems, not by ""mining"" them.

There are 7000 hunters calling for the withdrawal of this progressive piece of legislation. Let us ensure that we outnumber them by filling out this form in support of the White Paper, which we will submit to the Department on your behalf.

The EMS Foundation and the Wild Law Institute jointly submitted comments in response to the invitation from the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment on the Draft White Paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of South Africa's Biodiversity.

2. DRAFT SOUTH AFRICAN GAME MEAT STRATEGY

The Draft strategy aims to formalise the game meat sector and open doors for informal game meat traders and previously disadvantaged communities, which according to the Department will create an organised game meat industry, based on achieving the economies of scale that are necessary for commercial ventures based primarily on game meat production, harvesting and marketing.

The EMS Foundation believes that Draft Game Meat Strategy is in direct conflict with the government's Draft White paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity.

The EMS Foundation is cognisant of the entanglement of oppression and we are committed to the promotion of inclusive justice, showing compassion across species and working to build a better future for all through campaigns, research, analysis, advocacy and holding government to account.

The EMS Foundation also has a special interest in biodiversity.  We support the five interrelated principles of social justice, namely: equity, access, diversity, participation and rights.

The Draft Game Meat Strategy advocates for the industrial-scale breeding, farming and slaughter of wild animals.  Increasing South Africa's role in the global game meat production as proposed by the Draft Game Meat Strategy, will increase the risks associated with the transmission of zoonotic diseases.

The Draft document is fundamentally flawed and has the potential to kill millions of wild animals, which is harmful both to the environment and could negatively affect human rights in South Africa. This Draft should be withdrawn in its entirety. If you would like to see the withdrawal of this policy, fill out this form and we will submit it to the Department on your behalf.

The DG Murray Trust calls on mobile network operators; Vodacom South Africa, MTN South Africa, Telkom South Africa, rain South Africa and Cell C South Africa to urgently zero-rate the services of all public benefit organisations (PBOs) that provide digital content for early learning and education. In this way, preschool and schooling will be able to continue to some extent, reaching children on cellphones in their own homes. This is crucial, given the closure of early childhood development centres and schools during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DGMT CEO Dr David Harrison states that “the recommendation to zero-rate mobile content provided by PBOs is contained in the report of the Competition Commission into mobile data costs, and network operators have already indicated their willingness to implement that proposal.  The time to do it is now.” The network operators have already committed to this, so there is no reluctance to put this plan in motion from their part. It is only a question of time, as this must happen sooner than we all anticipated.

DGMT supports a number of community-level programmes which together reach hundreds of thousands of young children. They include the Nal’ibali national reading campaign, SmartStart early learning programme, Grow Great national zero-stunting campaign (which provides nutrition-related support and training to young mothers), Public Schools Partnerships, Activate! Leadership and JobStarter. All of these programmes will now rely heavily on mobile data to continue to reach and support practitioners, parents and children. In addition to these programmes, there are hundreds of other non-profit organisations providing services for early childhood development and literacy and numeracy development.

“Access to these crucial services for education now rests squarely in the hands of the leadership of mobile network operators”, says Dr Harrison.  “The coronavirus will hit poorer communities hardest. We trust that they will take the lead in ensuring that its impact does not further erode the prospects for our nation’s children.”"

A more complete, BUT NOT EXHAUSTIVE, list of 37 (!!!) such death threats, together with the decision of the Latvian Police to initiate criminal proceedings on the facts of death threats, is here.



Important preamble

On 5 January 2023 an article about my monstrous story was published by Orato World Media, titled ""Man battles Russian Oligarchs in court, survives assassination attempts”, which speaks for itself.



The article describes (1) repeated attempts to kill me; (2) constant death threats against me and even my children with demands to drop the English lawsuit; (3) a crazy criminal case fabricated in Russia against me, with the help of which they tried to take me hostage and blackmailed me; (4) my flight to Europe, where I was granted asylum and international protection. And all this is a ""reward"" to me from Putin's oligarchs for the fact that I once saved them from prison and ruin.

On 26 February in the British press an article was published about my story, focusing on the attempts to kill me in Russia and the criminal (extortion and corruption) activities of the oligarchs in the UK.

On 28 February, one of the American human rights channels aired my detailed interview the main topic of which is the export of corruption by Russian oligarchs to Western countries. Using specific examples, I have demonstrated how this happens in relation to my story described in the petition. We talked about how destructive the export of corruption is for Western countries and the need to stop it.



I thank the journalists for their interest in my extremely unusual story!



PETITION

The purpose of this petition to the British and Latvian authorities - I demand to prosecute the super-rich Putin's oligarchs for crimes (extortion, corruption and others) committed in the UK and EU.

Main theses:

_______________________________________________________________

Information about these Russian oligarchs, me and the background of the court case

The defendants in case CL-2016-000831 are the Russian oligarchs who own one of the largest Russian companies PhosAgro (listed on the London Stock Exchange) and one of which (Mr Guryev) is known as the owner of the most luxurious real estate in England (Witanhurst Palace worth 300 million pounds, second only to Buckingham Palace, and a four-story penthouse in London's tallest skyscraper, as discovered by investigative journalists).

Mr Guryev and his son, who headed PhosAgro, have been included in the sanctions lists of the US, UK, EU, Australia and other countries after the Putin regime started the crazy war in Ukraine. The US authorities, for example, justified these sanctions as follows:



HOWEVER, EVEN THEIR INCLUSION IN THE SANCTIONS LISTS DOES NOT STOP THEM FROM CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES IN THE UK AND EU.

In England, these oligarchs actively lobby for their interests, using ties with the English elite. For example, PhosAgro's board of directors has been chaired in recent years by the former head of the London Stock Exchange, Mr Xavier Rolet, who stepped down only after he was criticized for working for the oligarchs close to Putin, who started the war in Ukraine.

The filing of the lawsuit was preceded by the criminal actions of these oligarchs (the criminality of their actions is confirmed by the opinions of several lawyers), as a result of which I essentially turned out to be a beggar. At the same time, I didn’t do anything bad to them, but on the contrary, I brought them a profit of about $ 1 billion. However, after I fulfilled my obligations, they changed their minds about fulfilling their obligations, and moreover, with the help of fraudulent actions, they created my artificial debt to them. That is, instead of receiving remuneration for my work, I myself became to be a debtor of these oligarchs under fraudulent loan agreements drawn up in secret from me and subject to English law. At the same time, these oligarchs:

An eloquent description of the criminal case fabricated against me was given by my 70-year-old former lawyer Valery Stepanov, widely known in Russia, in his witness statement for the English court:



Shortly after submitting of this testimony to the defendants, Mr Stepanov died in Russia under very strange circumstances, about which the defendants did not hide their joy. Shortly before his death, Valery Stepanov told me that they tried to hack his WhatsApp account, which he connected with his participation as a witness in my case.

I will cite a few more eloquent quotations from this witness statement:

______________________________________________________________

EXTORTION EPISODE 1

(The death threats of 2018 against me and even my children with demands to drop the court claim)

The lawsuit was filed back in 2016, but the defendants avoided receiving notifications of the lawsuit for several years. During this time period, I received regular death threats from them, accompanied by demands to drop the claim. These threats were addressed not only to me, but even to my minor children. Some quotes (from audio recordings):

The incomplete list of such threats includes 37 (!!!) positions. In addition to these direct threats, accompanied by the direct demands to drop the lawsuit, I receive veiled threats, such as emails from fake addresses offering to book my funeral in advance with the promise of a £500 discount.

In Latvia, where I have been living as a refugee since 2016, the criminal case was opened in October 2022 on these death threats.

However, the investigation is clearly being slowed down with full clarity of the picture and so far, no one has been brought to criminal responsibility. In addition, without explaining the reasons, my demands are ignored to reclassify part of the death threats from just death threats (this crime is insignificant) to extortion under death threats, criminal liability for which reaches 12 years of imprisonment with confiscation of property. Therefore, I had to send an application to the Prosecutor General of Latvia, Mr Juris Stukāns, and I am waiting for his decision.

The lower prosecutor motivated the refusal to reclassify death threats to extortion under death threats by the fact that the property claims and threats were allegedly not sufficiently insistent.

In paragraph 4 of my application to the Prosecutor General of Latvia in relation to one of several cases of explicit extortion, I gave the verbatim content of 8 (!!!) fragments during a 21-minute conversation with a representative of the oligarchs containing monstrous threats and at the same time demands to drop the lawsuit. This verbatim description is based on an audio recording available here.

In paragraph 5, I summed it up: “I am absolutely sure that when during a 21-minute conversation 8 (!!!) monstrous death threats are being made (not only against me, but even against my wife and children), accompanied by property demands, no one can have any doubts about whether these threats and demands can be considered insistent. They are extremely and excessively insistent!”

_____________________________________________________________

EXTORTION EPISODE 2

An attempt of 2021 to capture the lawsuit under death threats, ACCOMPANIED BY THE WORDS THAT THE OLIGARCHS WILL BRIBE MY BRITISH LAWYERS AND EVEN JUDGES

In 2021, I finally managed to notify the defendants of the lawsuit and the proceedings moved into the active stage. Against this background, the defendants sent some people to me who, threatening to kill, demanded that I assign the plaintiff's rights to these persons (that is, in their own words, they tried to capture the lawsuit).



“Bobylev: Look, Igor, I have such a question. Imagine that I am you. I am Igor Sychev, and you are the judge. And here sits our defendant [Mr Guryev]. Please tell me, now you are a judge and you are A BRIBED JUDGE. This is not possible in the English court, but we will imagine for a moment that you are THE BRIBED JUDGE. What would you cling to to make a decision not in my favor? Here you are the judge, you are THE BRIBED JUDGE, you need to cling to something. The judge is guided, except for his wig, by his conscience, he is not guided by anything else, this is in any legislation of the world. Now, what would you say? What would A RIBED JUDGE cling to?

Me: I can't even imagine.

Bobylev: Is everything going so fine for you? But in principle, we were told the same thing”.

The death threats of 2021 are also the subject of the investigation by the Latvian police, however, with all the clarity of the picture (it is known on the basis of the supporting audio recordings who exactly made the threats, when, under what circumstances), no one has been still brought to criminal responsibility for this series of episodes so far either.

Also, for this series of episodes, the Latvian police refuses to reclassify crimes from just death threats to extortion under death threats, motivating by the same thing – allegedly insufficient insistence of the demands and threats. On this occasion, in paragraph 14 of my application to the Prosecutor General of Latvia, I wrote the following: “Information about specific threats, indicating the date and who exactly made the threats and demands, and with an audio recording attached for each specific case, is contained in the following paragraphs of this detailed document: 41-42 (several threats at once), 79, 94, 98, 99, 117, 122, 138, 139, 141, 143, that is, in aggregate at least 11 times, and if we take into account that during a personal meeting in Riga on 21.06.21 (paragraphs 41-42) threats were voiced repeatedly in various forms (at least 5, directly indicated in paragraph 41), then we will get 15 (!!!) times in total. Isn't that insistent enough?!”

Summing up the events of 2018 and 2021, in paragraph 20 of the application to the Prosecutor General of Latvia, I wrote the following: “Thus, with regard to the events of 2018 and 2021, it is extremely obvious that death threats accompanied by property demands were more than insistent. IN TOTAL, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AT LEAST 25 SEPARATE FACTS OF DEATH THREATS ACCOMPANIED BY PROPERTY DEMANDS. If such a huge amount is not enough to consider these threats and demands insistent, then it is difficult for me to imagine what can then be considered insistence"".

Bribery by the Russian oligarchs of my British lawyers

First case

The story of bribing my British lawyers (law firm Candey) is also described in my interview of August 2022. In order not to retell this story, I will quote my recent open letter addressed to these lawyers (the letter remained unanswered). In short, my lawyers began insistently and even aggressively demanding that my response to the 2,600 pages of documents of the Russian oligarchs be formulated only on 3-5 pages and consist only of headings and hints.

1. I refer to our previous correspondence on the issue that you, being the lawyers representing the claimants in the case CL-2016-000831 (that is, me) in August of last year, colluded with the defendants (were bribed by them).

2. I have to contact you again because there will be two court hearings in the CL-2016-000831 case in the near future and the question of why the claimants are not represented by lawyers is always raised.

3. I explicitly state in court documents and during hearings that the defendants have colluded with my last solicitors (that is, you), which resulted in your acting not in the best interests of your clients, but in the interests of the opposite party. Namely, on the eve of the deadline, you began aggressively insisting that the claimants' response to the defendants' applications of more than 2,600 pages should be formulated on 3-5 pages and consist exclusively of headlines and hints (more about this is in the transcript of our last two conversations, which I reattach for convenience).

4. At the same time, it was intended that the following information should be provided on these 3-5 pages: (a) forging by the defendants of the main evidence used by them in these proceedings; (b) the knowingly false nature of five expert opinions that the defendants submitted; (c) the threats of the defendants to kill me, including the threats, accompanied by the demands to drop the lawsuit; (d) the fact that the defendants have fabricated the criminal case against me; (e) the other numerous facts of wrongdoing on the part of the defendants.

5. For any adequate person (not only for a lawyer), it is obvious that if such information is presented on 3-5 pages (and only in the form of headlines and hints) and does not include evidence confirming this information, it will be simply ridiculous, stupid and strange, and any everyman will raise questions about the adequacy of lawyers who give such advice. You have refused to answer my questions and comments on this matter, both during the time when our contract was still in effect and in subsequent correspondence.

6. At the same time, when I directly accused you of colluding with the defendants during the termination of our agreement on my initiative, you threatened me with criminal prosecution for spreading such information. Hoping that I would not double-check your threats, you have deceived me by claiming that there is criminal liability for libel in the UK.

7. In addition to (1) not answering my legitimate questions about the adequacy of your advice and (2) aggressively threatening me with various legal consequences if I spread information about your bribing by the defendants, you also began to demand payment of 165 thousand pounds from me, without even answering the most primitive questions about how this amount was calculated. In particular, I refer to your letter of 14 October 2021.

8. That information, for the distribution of which you diligently frightened me, has already become public in the UK, and the article about this was published in an authoritative legal newspaper more than a month ago.

9. Earlier (in August) this information has become public in Latvia.

10. I know for certain that neither the defendants nor you tried to take any measures to refute the information that has become public. At the same time, in Latvia, unlike the UK, there is criminal liability for defamation. It was in Latvia that such information was first published.

11. I take your behavior as confirmation of the fact that it is already obvious to any sane person that you have colluded with the defendants (were bribed by them), which is a serious crime.

12. I demand to explain by the end of the day on 1 December why you did not implement your numerous threats and do not take any measures at all to refute the information about the defendants' bribery of you. I once again insist on my accusations and give you one last opportunity to present a reasonable alternative explanation for your extremely strange (for any layman) behavior (1) both in August 2021, when you aggressively were giving me extremely strange advice, (2) and now, when information about the bribery has become public, but you, despite all your previous threats, do not take any measures that you threatened if this information is distributed.

13. Until a reasonable explanation appears, I consider the fact that the defendants have bribed you proved (if we talk about the civil law standard of proof, then there is not the slightest doubt about this). The details of how the conspiracy and receipt of the bribe took place can and should be established by the investigating authorities.

14. This letter is open (public).

Of course, there is no response from Candey even to this open letter.



The second case

As for the story related to Signature Litigation, it is described in the update of 28 January.

________________________________________________________

Deputy Judge of the High Court of England and Wales, Mr Beltrami KC, HIDING FROM ME HIS CLOSE TIES WITH THE LAWYERS OF THE OLIGARCHS, after bribery by them of my lawyers, essentially deprived me of access to justice EXACTLY ON THAT BASIS THAT NOW I HAVE NO LAWYERS (!!!)

So, after the monstrous lawlessness described above only partially, I had the last hope to achieve justice in the English court, which is famous for its fairness, integrity, incorruptibility and impartiality, but my hopes have been ruined.

Blocking, in fact, access to justice for me, deputy judge Mr Beltrami KC wrote in his judgment literally the following:

This judgment has not been published anywhere, and it was about my request that I personally, in the absence of lawyers, could represent the interests of the plaintiffs, since there is no one else can represent them, because (1) as a result of the fraudulent behavior of the defendants, I was left without money and cannot pay for the services of lawyers, and (2) those lawyers who agreed to work on the terms of “no win – no fee” were bribed by the Russian oligarchs in the most primitive way.

After the hearing conducted by Mr Beltrami KC, I found out from publicly available sources that he had been working for the lawyers of these Russian oligarchs for many years, and their relationship became so close that Mr Beltrami KC's son began working for Simmons & Simmons, representing these Russian oligarchs.

This information was not disclosed to me either before or during the court hearing, despite the fact that the Guide to Judicial Conduct states:

That is, due to non-disclosure of information, I was deprived of the opportunity to apply for recusal of Mr Beltrami KC, who turned out to be closely connected with the lawyers of the Russian oligarchs and who actually made a fateful decision in their favor, without considering at least one argument on the merits.

In the future, I tried to ensure that I could continue conducting the case in person without lawyers, but my attempts were stopped by the High Court with reference to the decision of Mr Beltrami KC, and on 9 December, Mr Justice Picken actually terminated the lawsuit without consideration on the merits and obliged me to compensate the defendants for the costs they incurred for conducting the case, which it cannot be continued actually due to the lack of lawyers.

At the last hearing before Mr Justice Picken, I tried at least to ensure that the costs of these Russian oligarchs were not shifted to me, who, as a result of the defendants' fraudulent actions, essentially became a beggar. In support of my request, I referred to the fact that, according to the several direct provisions of the law (Rules 44.2(4)-(5) and 44.4(3) and 44.11 of the Civil Procedure Rules), when considering issues of costs, the conduct of the parties both prior to and during the proceedings should be taken into account.

In particular, I referred to the enormity of the behavior of the Russian oligarchs who fraudulently deceived me; fabricated the criminal case with which they blackmailed me; repeatedly threatened me and my family members with murder, demanding to drop the claim - that is, to those facts that have irrefutable confirmation. But Mr Justice Picken considered that these irrefutably proven facts of the monstrous behavior of the Russian super-rich oligarchs should not be taken into account as their negative behavior and decided that I should compensate these oligarchs for costs in the full amount requested by them.

CONCLUSION

I DEMAND:

I am sure that if the illegal activities of Putin's super-rich oligarchs in the UK and EU do not receive a proper legal assessment from the British and European authorities, it will provoke them to further illegal actions and undermine faith in British public institutions. This lawlessness must be stopped!"

Suddenly a too-narrow door, or one step outside of a restaurant turned the daily activities I had always taken for granted into huge obstacles. When most people plan to go to a restaurant they don't have to worry about whether they'll actually be able to get in the door to meet their friends, or whether they'll be able to get into a bathroom stall. Many of us just choose stay home rather than face these challenges - there's got to be a better way.

Google Maps has the ability to help people with disabilities across the world. Currently Google Maps has different options -- you can add traffic info, bike info or weather info to your maps. People with mobility challenges like me need Google Maps to include an accessibility option so that we are able to find out in advance which buildings, transit stations etc. are accessible to us or not!

No one wants to discriminate, but accessibility isn't something most people have to think about ever, thankfully. Most of the time I just need to point out why something is inaccessible for people in wheelchairs and people spring into action. I'm hoping that's the case with Google. After all, their motto is: don't be evil.

Google already designs their products to be accessible for blind and deaf people, so we know they already care about accessibility.

When I first lost the ability to walk, I felt invisible. I had been an industrial millwright mechanic for 30 years and suddenly couldn't do that anymore. But I decided to see my disability as a new challenge. I went back to college to study Community and Justice Services, and I developed a passion for helping others.

I started this because I know that not only would an accessibility feature on Google Maps change the daily lives of people with disabilities around the world, but more importantly, it would be saying that people with accessibility challenges matter too.

There are two ways this should happen that would be easy for Google!

1) Work with other map aps that are working on mapping accessibility. There are a couple map programs that I know of already. They are excellent, but Google has the ability to reach the whole world. One solution could be for Google to work with aps like Axsmap, Wheelmap or and Planat and integrate their data into google maps. Everyone would benefit.

2) Include an ""accessibility"" review on Google+ so that when people click on a location on Google maps they are able to look up or contribute to an accessibility review. This could be useful for people with different challenges. For example, the fact that a restaurant has a ramp outside and also a menu in braille could be listed."
123,DISABILITY LIVES MATTER - #JUSTICEFORALL,working in the disability sector we find that there is still  large scale exclusion and their ability to understand and to respond to situations may be affected by their disability with a disability.

Every human being has an inherent right to life, including persons with disabilities as their rights are not special rights but human rights. Fundamental to these rights is access to justice, including a police force that respects their rights and understands how to interact with them.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 13.2, states: “In order to ensure effective access to justice for persons with disabilities, State Parties shall promote appropriate training for those working in the field of administration of justice, including police and prison staff”.

Down Syndrome South Africa (DSSA) and it’s member associations, supported by Down Syndrome International strongly condemns all violence against individuals with Down syndrome, including the killing of Nathaniel Julies, a 16-year old with Down syndrome, on Wednesday 26th August 2020 in Eldorado Park, Johannesburg.

Down syndrome is a genetic condition caused by an extra chromosome 21, known as Trisomy 21. This extra chromosome alters the course of development both physically and cognitively, which includes communication impairment.

As organisations working in the disability sector we find that there is still  large scale exclusion and marginalization of persons with disabilities because their abilities to communicate may be impaired or because their ability to understand and to respond to situations may be affected by their disability.

Because their conduct is different from the expected norm, the view that the lives of persons with disabilities is worth less than those without disabilities is entrenched.

Persons with disabilities are at risk of being victimized or may be exploited to their detriment and indeed physical harm.

They have the ability to be a positive role model and influence on the citizens that entrusts them to ""Protect and serve"" at all times while doing what's in the best interest of those who need them the most. The Law Enforcement Oath of Honor states: ""On my honor, I will never betray my badge, my integrity, my character or the public trust. I will always have the courage to hold myself and others accountable for our actions I will always uphold the constitution, my community, and the agency I serve."" With that being said, officers are failing to honor this oath by unjustly murdering innocent citizens within their own communities, and are not being held fully accountable for their actions.

This has been an ongoing problem, and drastic changes need to be made in order to resolve the ""civil unrest"" that is occurring globally. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 11, states: ""Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed INNOCENT until PROVEN GUILTY according to law in a public trial at which he/she has had all the guarantees necessary for his defense.""

In the wake of the egregious behavior by Officer Chauvin shown in the viral video of the murder of Mr. George Floyd, Americans are seeing a pattern of African American men and women being unjustly murdered for minor/misdemeanor offenses or no obvious reason at all. This pattern is mainly being exhibited in encounters with African Americans, but have occurred with other races as well, and citizens are fed up with the tyranny that they're experiencing. Families all over America are tired of burying their loved ones due to false assumptions being made by police officers. Changes have to be made and accountability has to be taken when officers' violate their oath.

We're asking that law enforcement officers' be held fully accountable by enacting ""The Police Accountability Act,"" which would entail harsher sentences by immediate arrests, immediate termination, losing their jobs WITHOUT pay, and longer prison sentences when they're found to be in violation of conduct that leads to injury/death of another person. The primary reason why their behavior continues to happen is because there is no consequences for their actions, which causes distrust from the citizens. Additionally, there should be complete transparency after these incidents because there have been many instances when there seemed to be more sympathy for the police officer than the victim who lost their life, which is an insult to the families who have lost someone tragically.

The Health Star Rating System ranges from ½ a star to 5 stars, and was designed to help consumers make healthier choices. Recent news media has outlined some issues with this star rating system, but the big problem comes in the form of food manufacturers and companies calculating the star rating on their own food products.

Their motto is literally the more stars the healthier the choice. This self-regulation poses a big problem in accuracy and accountability, is misleading, and creates confusion for consumers.

The Sipahh straws pictured in the video above actually PROMOTE that they 'only' contain half a teaspoon of sugar per straw. They receive a 4.5 star rating from the Government approved Health Star Rating System.

The ingredients are sugar, gluten free starch from tapioca, cocoa powder, bulking agent, buling agent (maltodextrin), flavour, sweetener (sucralose). How on EARTH does this deserve 4.5 stars??!! The first ingredient sugar and there is no nutritional value or benefit in sugar filled straws!!

Let's look at another example such as Up & Go, which also has 4.5 stars. The ingredients are Filtered Water, Skim Milk Powder Maltodextrin (Wheat, Corn) Cane Sugar, Vegetable Fibre, Soy Protein, Vegetable Oils (Sunflower, Canola), Fructose, Oat Flour, Flavour, Acidity Regulator (332), Mineral (Calcium), Vegetable Gums (460, 466, 407), Stabiliser (452), Vitamins (C, Niacin, Al B12, B6, B2, B1, Folate), Salt.

Up & Go is PACKED with sugar, inflammatory vegetable/seed oils, numbers and chemicals. FAR from a health food, yet most consumers would trust the packaging and the GOVERNMENT APPROVED health star rating. This is not ok.

Further to this, the calculation should be based on current food science and knowledge. Unfortunately the criteria does not establish how 'healthy' a food like product really is.

There are many studies that are now showing that saturated fat and cholesterol should no longer be feared and are actually an excellent, protective and necessary part of the diet to support cellular health, brain function, sexual and reproductive function, the immune system and many other important physiological functions in the body (when used sensibly and as part of balanced overall food intake).

Some studies to note

Just ONE of these studies was published in the Medical Journal of Clinical Nutrition and involved a 5–23 year of follow-up of 347,747 subjects.

The meta-analysis of prospective epidemiologic studies showed that there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of CHD or CVD. More data are needed to elucidate whether CVD risks are likely to be influenced by the specific nutrients used to REPLACE saturated fat.

The Health Star Rating system is EXTREMELY corrupt.

Why don't the Government invest in supporting local farmers, subsiding and educating and promoting fresh vegetables, fruit and well looked after, 100% grass fed animal products. Why are they still promoting vegetable/seed oils when the science is clear, they are inflammatory. Why isn't the focus on farmers markets and WHOLE, REAL FOODS instead of lining the pockets of the processed food industry and destroying the health of our nation? Why don't we have low cost cooking classes and educational seminars? Community gardens and chook pens in every neighbourhood for fresh eggs?

Food CAN be cheap and accessible. Every person, family and child, deserves fresh, quality food and deserve to know what they are feeding themselves and their kids. Stop green washing the packaged processed products and start having an honest, transparent and open relationship with the food system.

Despite threats of boycotts, most countries did send athletes to the Games. The United States Olympic Committee president at the time, Avery Brundage, insisted that “politics has no place in sport”.

In 2008, the Summer Olympics was held in Beijing. Showing to the world an increasingly confident, open, and powerful country, the Beijing Games belied the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime’s lack of regard to human rights. Eleven years since the Games, the world has now learned their appalling violation of human rights: concentration camps for the Uyghurs, the suppression of Muslims and Christians, the imprisonment of human rights activists and lawyers, including Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who died in jail, a walled-off internet which tolerates no dissent, and more recently, the heavy-handed approach in response to the protests in Hong Kong.

Politics may, and should, have no place in sport, but when Daryl Morey, the general manager of Houston Rockets, provoked angry reactions from China after he voiced his support for Hong Kong’s protesters, the world must make it clear to CCP that enough is enough.

Can you hear me out my fellow earthians out there ....anyone with wisdom and compassion you can be convinced that it's not an emotionally drafted article but it states the sequence of legal events in order as per my knowledge.

It's the lament of my womb.....a shiver runs through my womb when my little one's are disturbed.....

Till date had been very patient and forgiving to the people who harassed me and my girl children and had been focusing on my kids and my career without depending on any sort of financial aid from my ex husband Paul Rajan or his family and relinquishing our rights. I had been subjected to every form of torture both physical and mental while I was expecting my first baby. I used to be threatened to give birth to a boy child as the main reason my mother in law would state was that 'parampara ninnu pokum'. And my father in law would say 'you won't be let inside this house'. It aggravated as days and years passed by wherein my father in law Rajan Mampilly sexually abused my infant child and me in the presence of his wife, my mother in law. And his son  Paul Rajan laughed it all out when told about it.

I got married while doing my second year graduation and though a submissive soft spoken girl I had a high level of tolerance to pain and also a forgiving mentality and I just focused on my little kids ignoring and suffering silently all the torture meted out to me and kids, like being locked inside and starved, beaten up and sweared with derogatory comments from my husband and father in law. Yes the biggest mistake of my life where in I did not utter a word to the outside world and in fact always was out with a smile in public.

But the night we were chased with a knife in April 2012 and I ran for life wrapping my kids and locked ourselves inside a room. The power of motherhood gave me all the boldness to stand up for my little one's. I filed FIR and relocated to Bangalore. An FIR 498A under section, 154 Cr.P.C was filed in Ernakulam Central Police station on 16-4-2012, FIR no. 980 against Paul Rajan,1st accused. Rajan Mampilly 2nd accused, Alice Rajan, 3rd accused, Anu Babu 4th accused. Based on the police investigation & report, all the 4 accused Paul, Rajan Mampilly, Alice and Anu were Charge Sheeted by the Honorable Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Cochin. Chargesheet no.2003/12 on 23/7/2012.

And from then on I used to be threatened to withdraw the chargesheet , political heads, religious heads, police commissioners used to call me up and ask me to withdraw the chargesheet or I that I would have face bitter consequences. When none of these threats influenced my decision, Paul Rajan filed for Custody OP of kids in Kerala family court in Cochin in August 2012. The custody case was not maintainable as me and kids were residents of Bangalore since April 2012 much before the custody OP was filed. And I had official documents supporting the fact, kids admission receipts, rental agreement and my job certificate all solid evidence that kids and me were in Bangalore since 2012 June.

Unfortunately all the counsels I appointed either misrepresented us or did not represent us at all in the court. We were misguided by the counsel to file transfer petition in Supreme court which got rejected in spite of me submitting the needed documents. It seems its one of the rarest things when a transfer petition by a mother is rejected in the history of Supreme Court as mentioned by a an eminent lawyer.

He started continuously to harass us sending police to our house, creating mess in the school and apartment we live etc and our life became miserable. Police men along with Paul Rajan's driver would barge into our house at odd timing late in the evening at 8.30 pm or early morning etc. And it was a regular incident for me and kids to wake upto trauma early mornings and when the calling bell rang with police men in uniform after 6.30 pm. Finally I filed

FIR against Mr. Paul Rajan on 8/11/2013 in Electronic City police station, Bangalore. FIR no 0431/2013.

Paul Rajan with his influence sent few police men to our house early one morning at around 5.30 am and we were dragged out of our house and taken in Police vehicle and detained in police station and were harassed by police officials without mercy, derogatory comments, threats and police men almost tried groping us and was not moving away when my kids started recording video with the phone he moved away but still we were feeling insecure. My SOS call on FB got in inquiries from media which shielded us from greater danger. We have pictures and videos of Police men inside our house not even letting us to change in privacy before being taken to Kerala. Are even terrorists treated like this? We were dumped behind a police vehicle and an overnight journey to be presented before the High Court of Kerala. I appeared IN PERSON without a counsel before the Honorable CHIEF JUSTICE of HIGH COURT, Kerala following which A JUDGEMENT was passed by the Honorable Chief Justice Shri Ashok Bhushan in mine and kid's favor DISPOSING OFF contempt also mentioning that contempt was under INAPPROPRIATE GROUNDS and also ordered for Police Protection and to escort us to our residence in Bangalore. Chief justice also made an oral statement to request the Bangalore Commissioner and to file for protection in High Court of Bangalore. I wrote to the city police commissioner Bangalore and I was assured through a mail of support and things were almost secure for us legally.

But before long he again got ex-party custody order from family court Kerala and kids and me were summoned. Kids were taken for chamber counseling before the Judge and they expressed their traumatic experience and unwillingness to meet him or go with him. Judge issued an order stating kid's unwillingness to go with the father.

But recently again he has triggered lots of panic and disrupted our peaceful living. Till recently the school was very supportive as they knew the reality of how I am struggling to make ends meet as a single mother. But last week school expressed their fear as they mentioned that they cannot do anything against the High command as Paul Rajan has managed to convince the CMI head incharge in Bangalore. And school authorities ask me not to admit kids there next year as the High Command, CMI head is not willing. Present Scenario: Now in midst their final exams Paul Rajan has got a Family court order for the kids to be given to him on 23rd & 24th of March 2016 and kids are devastated. I am shattered and as a last resort I am trying to get some public help by posting a petition in change.org and twitter, FB posts.

I suffered silently till it came to a point when my kid's life was in danger. And we are not dependent on Paul Rajan for money or anything else. I forgave and spared them and never went in to defame them and just focused on mine and kid's peace but still we are being victimized and abused for no fault of ours.

I have no more energy left, neither I have power or money but only these kid's and their testimony which they speak out and my trust in God. There is no one to help us. This is my last resort. Don't we deserve to live our life peacefully?

Isn't it common sense and wisdom that normal, healthy, independent and smart kids who excel in everything despite every trauma cannot be tamed to speak out as per any parent's wish? And for sure not all 3 can be tamed? Yes my daughters have posted on Fb and has published video too which is for sure under my guidance as they needed to highlight the important points.

To anyone who is not convinced about the video content or post, my kids are very much before the society, that any genuine authority who wants to know the truth and is capable of granting justice can always approach the kids. Kids have cried out in public in the High court before Chief Justice and in the open court at the Family court. Their grief and agony has been witnessed by the general public too multiple times when they were arrested or summoned to court.

According to the Family Court Act, A Family court exists for the welfare of women and children, were in there are no hard and fast rules and there is not even a need of a counsel. Apart from that, most important evidence of Chamber Counseling in the mother's absence and an order following which clearly states the unwillingness of the kids to go with the father, my kids are being tortured and their education is being disrupted.

1. How can a Family Court which exists for welfare of women and children give ex-party custody order to a father who is already charge sheeted by CJM court for abuse of his girl children much before the custody OP is filed by Paul Rajan, the abuser father?2.After chamber counseling and as stated in the unwillingness order about set aside petition filed by the mother, why isn't the set aside petition being taken for hearing and after so long why hasn't the ex-party custody order been set aside?3. Why hasn't the judge issued interim custody or permanent custody order for the mother following chamber counseling and kid's testimony following which he issued an order stating kid's unwillingness?4. Why does the present counsel appointed from Legal service Authority, Kerala, helpless in even getting the set aside petition to hearing after so long?5. Why is it neglected that kids are being disturbed unnecessarily in school and its disrupting their education, dignified and peaceful living when there is Supreme court ruling that kids cannot be forced to be sent or meet the guardian they are not willing to? And as per High Court Ruling isn't mother the natural guardian of girl children?6.And as per child psychology would children be performers in academics and extracurricular if they were not happy with the mother so far? 7. Isn't this Girl Child Abuse infact Abuse of 3 Girl Children?8. Inspite of FIR in Bangalore against Paul Rajan and me& kids being permanent residents of Karnataka, he still manages to trouble kids in school/get warrants against us and torture and defame us. What is the whole point of FIR and Chargesheet? Are these means of FIR and chargsheet insignificant before money and corruption and no value to life of Girl children where posters throughout the country proclaims protection of girl children. 9. And what is my fault ? why am I being harassed? Is it for the simple reason that am concerned about the day to day welfare of kids and after the day to day welfare am left without energy, power or money to tackle this manipulated and corrupt atmosphere around us which is devouring me alive. Is my fault that gave birth to girl children and that my priority is their happiness and peace? 10. The next possible option for me and kids is to challenge the family court decisions in High Court but unless we have solid back up of State level or National level authorities, won't the same history of deceit, corruption and manipulation continue till these girls turn 18? 11. Why is our grievance being neglected by Human Right's commission and other organizations stating it's in the court? Is the lives of three girl children and their mother so insignificant?

Now its upto my co-earthians especially fathers

Had you loved your kids would you ever trouble them inspite of their unwillingness, would you have got them arrested?

Isn't it Blatant child's rights violation??

1. Blatant violation of child's rights as Paul Rajan is an accused by law for abusing his own girl children. Paul Rajan 1st accused, Rajan Mampilly 1st accused, Alice Rajan 3rd accused and Anu Babu 4th accused were Charge Sheeted by the Honorable Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Cochin. Chargesheet no.2003/12 on 23/7/2012. An FIR against Mr. Paul Rajan on 8/11/2013 in Electronic City police station, Bangalore. FIR no 0431/2013 all for abusing his girl children. And complaints lodged with City Police commssioners in Bangalore also existing.2. Blatant violation of child's rights denying kids education to a peaceful education disrupting exams.3. Blatant violation of child rights not respecting the testimony and the agony of kids expressing their unwillingness and fear to even meet Paul Rajan.4.Blatant violation of child's rights denying unwillingness court order following chamber counseling.5. Violation of child's rights denying the guardianship of the parent (mother whom the kids are with) who admitted the kids to the school and is looking after the day to day welfare of the kids. And the natural guardian of girl children as per High court ruling is the mother. And above all the kids testimony proves it all which is the only ultimate deciding factor by any court of law across the globe.

Myself Veena, a self made independent person. I am not not just a survivor but by all means a thriver of abuse and torture. I work as an Analyst and I have an immense passion for arts and entrepreneurship and do excel in various other fields of interest I pursue and I am proud to be the mother of 3 angels Shruti, Annika & Kiarra.

My fellow earthians, Thank you for bearing with me and having the patience to read through, it's upto you to take it or trash it. I have done my best yet and there is nothing more that I can do.

I also admit publicly through this testimony, that if my kids express their willingness in public or in court to meet or be with their father I would happily let them have their will as their wish is my command. But if that is not the case I will stand for their right till my last breath.

I conclude. Trusting in God the Almighty.... Let his will Be Done. Impossible Is Just An Illusion Veena Theresa

And whilst myself and our street support charity Project 16:15, amongst others, recognise the value and importance of having such places available, amongst the stepping stones of recovery and reestablishing dignity, we have also become increasingly aware that an independent, government backed authority is desperately needed to not only oversee the organisations running these places, but also to hold them accountable to their duty of care.

Too many charitable businesses, independent housing organisations, local councils and supported accommodation providers, are making an extortionate amount of money (up to £400 per resident on Housing benefit claims) whilst providing often less than the minimum levels of support needed or legally required, which is resulting in way too many individuals, already broken, hurting, struggling and demoralised, being set up to fail and kept on the profit producing revolving door of poverty.

Beavers are Evolutionary-Ecological Land Ethics in conservation biology, nature is an integrated system of negatively impact wetland conservation efforts and increase ecosystem instability, contributing to wetland construction and maintenance, few conservation initiatives protect them. 
Conservation","['Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry', 'Cataraqui Conservation Authority']",Heather Faye Lounder,"Saskatoon, Canada",2711,9 Mar 2021,https://assets.change.org/photos/8/qi/sg/RtQiSGekfHBIIYd-800x450-noPad.jpg?1615319537,"Central Ontario’s wetlands are currently under threat, but the species that protect and maintain them are largely ignored

Wetlands are important biodiversity hotspots which host an array of species disproportionate to their area, and provide important ecosystem functions like wildlife habitat, water filtration, flood protection, and promotion of human health and wellbeing. They have both intrinsic and utilitarian value, benefiting humans and other ecosystems in many different ways. Wetlands play a critical role in supporting Ontario’s species at risk, with over 20% relying directly on wetland ecosystems. These species include the Olive Sided Flycatcher, the Eastern Prairie Fringed Orchid, the Spotted Turtle, and countless other species which also rely on wetlands indirectly.

The importance of wetlands has become widely recognized,  resulting in the formation of various conservation initiatives, however these initiatives fall short in their effectiveness when they fail to consider important biotic influences on the maintenance and conservation of existing wetlands. Beavers are important ecosystem engineers which have a disproportionately large impact on ecosystem function relative to their abundance and biomass. They actively modify habitats by building dams, lodges, canals, and dens which work to slow water flow and raise water levels, creating wetlands.

According to Evolutionary-Ecological Land Ethics in conservation biology, nature is an integrated system of interdependent processes and components. The disruption of Beavers and their infrastructure therefore stands to negatively impact wetland conservation efforts and increase ecosystem instability, contributing to biodiversity loss. Throughout central Ontario, many people view Beavers as a nuisance animal, trapping or killing them and destroying their habitat. Despite the evidently important role of Beavers in wetland construction and maintenance, few conservation initiatives protect them.

Conservation Authorities Act: no discussion about the impact of Beavers in wetlands or how they facilitate ecosystem functionLakes and Rivers Improvement Act: no mention of the role of Beavers in maintaining and supporting lake and river ecosystems, therefore no protection offeredEndangered Species Act: prohibits harassment of Ontario species at risk, but does not discuss or protect the animals which create and maintain the habitat these species rely onOntario Wetland Conservation Strategy: largely only protects provincially significant wetlands, and offers no recognition or protection for Beavers which create and protect these unique ecosystems

This petition aims to demand that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, in accordance with the Cataraqui Conservation Authority, to change these policies to include Beavers, and classify their disturbance as a punishable act in conformity with each policy. I will be writing a letter to the relevant authorities at the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, as well as the Cataraqui Conservation Authority, employing them to make these changes. Every name signed here helps to strengthen the impact of that letter, and is one step closer to achieving the change needed for this species. I encourage you to sign and protect these essential ecosystem engineers from human disturbance and strengthen wetland conservation efforts. These policy changes would serve to protect currently existing wetlands on both public and private land, as well encourage the formation of new wetlands.

Wetland conservation is a complex issue which requires a united front to enact action. It is our duty to demand the change needed and spread our knowledge with others.

You can find additional information regarding the importance of Beavers in wetlands, and why they should be protected, below:

One of the reasons why your popularity has seen a dip is because you have failed to listen to the complaints of the Rakyat.

For the past 11 months, many Malaysians have raised complaints regarding Dr Maszlee Malik over his nonsensical policies such as black shoes and socks, his idea of introducing cashless payment in schools, setting up petrol stations on university ground, and so on.

One particular policy to introduce swimming as a co-curricular activity in schools is worrying to parents. Recently, a schoolboy died in Sabah during his swimming lessons. Maszlee has failed to understand that schools do not have enough teachers to supervise the children when they are in a swimming pool.

Early this year, he was also whacked for his statement urging teachers from Kelantan to stay on in Sabah and Sarawak to make the two East Malaysian states their MEDAN DAKWAH. https://www.malaysiakini.com/columns/457384 He gave a lame excuse saying that the work dakwah has nothing to do with the spread of religion to the children in these two states. The damage has been done and parents in Sabah and Sarawak have expressed their concerns over his statement.There are so many issues involving our government schools which have been highlighted to his attention, but till today, he has not even met up with the various parents' groups. One particular group had asked to brief him on what is happening on the ground but instead of meeting them, he delegated the job to his PRESS OFFICER! This is an insult of the highest order to us as parents who are concerned with what is happening to our children's schools. A complaint that I intentionally posted on the ministry's complaint website shows how defiant the school is towards the Circular No 1/2000 regarding the use of additional workbooks for children at Level 1 (Std 1-3).

Maszlee is a newbie in politics and has little or no experience in any administrative position. Even his PhD has nothing to do with public administration. To expect him to run a ministry that is so important to all Malaysians is like bringing the Pakatan Harapan Government to a political suicide. Despite complaints being raised to your kind attention, YAB Tun, either directly or indirectly, you have not taken the necessary actions to replace him with other more capable people.

We are concerned that the Pakatan Harapan government will lose many of its votes because of this minister that you have appointed.

WE, therefore, urge you to give more thoughts to the complaints raised by the people. It is for the sake of the future generation of Malaysians. Please read another piece by a columnist of Malaysiakini:https://www.malaysiakini.com/columns/470798 ""QUESTION TIME | Instead of worrying about the colour of students’ shoes and a cashless system in schools, Education Minister Maszlee Malik needs to focus on improving education, the most vital ingredient to upgrade skills, increase incomes, raise living standards and dispel ignorance........""

Thank you.

In base a presunti rischi di trasmissione virale, il Ministero dell'Istruzione indica il lunch box e le monoporzioni come una soluzione per consumare il pasto in classe.

Uno dei possibili scenari della mensa scolastica che si prefigura a settembre è questo: pasti in monoporzioni di plastica sigillate e menù semplificati stile fast food. Tradotto: cibo preparato a livello industriale in cucine centralizzate, tenuto al caldo a scuocere per ore (da 4 a 8) e infine veicolato a tutte le scuole, anche a quelle già dotate di cucina interna che non verrebbero più utilizzate.

La qualità del pasto peggiorerebbe perché la “semplificazione dei menu”, come dice il Piano Scuola, si tradurrà in pasta in bianco o al pomodoro, bastoncini, prosciutto e pizza.

NON C'È NESSUNA RAGIONE SCIENTIFICA CHE GIUSTIFICHI LE MONOPORZIONI

A dirlo è il dott. Franco Berrino in un’intervista sul tema. Anche tutta la documentazione scientifica prodotta dalle Istituzioni sanitarie internazionali e nazionali in tema di Covid e ristorazione* afferma che nella manipolazione del cibo è sufficiente l’applicazione e il rafforzamento delle Buone Pratiche Igieniche.

Anzi, le monoporzioni stesse rischiano di essere una soluzione dannosa per la salute dei bambini: come indica l’evidenza scientifica il cibo processato, impoverito dei suoi valori nutrizionali e protettivi è causa di patologie cronico-degenerative. I menù semplificati, sbilanciati e distanti dalla dieta mediterranea in termini di varietà e qualità nutrizionale sono fra le principali cause dell’obesità.

Tutto ciò impatterebbe ancor di più su quei bambini che vivono in condizioni di povertà assoluta (oltre un milione) per i quali il pasto scolastico rappresenta l’unica occasione di nutrirsi correttamente.

L’ALIBI DELLA PANDEMIA PER L’AUMENTO DELLE TARIFFE

Secondo gli stessi operatori del mercato, questo sistema pasto è più oneroso, al punto tale da richiedere una revisione dei contratti perché aggiungerebbe nuovi costi, come l’acquisto di stoviglie usa e getta e termosigillatrici e i maggiori oneri di pulizia. OLTRE AL DANNO LA BEFFA!

C'È DI PIU’

Il cibo rifiutato e gettato perché scotto e meno gustoso aumenterebbe (oggi siamo già al 30%).Si prevede una perdita di posti di lavoro (femminili): le addette al servizio pasto nelle scuole e nelle Aziende diventerebbero superflue.L’impatto ambientale sarebbe enorme:  in un anno scolastico si produrrebbero più di 11 kg di rifiuti di plastica a bambino! Ma non dovevamo abbandonare la plastica usa e getta??

UNA SOLUZIONE C'È!Affrontare la pandemia da Covid puntando sulla salute e sull'educazione ambientale delle nuove generazioni. Perché una sana e buona alimentazione è fondamentale per fare prevenzione.

Lo scorso Marzo il Ministero dell’Ambiente ha varato i nuovi Criteri Ambientali Minimi (CAM) per la Ristorazione Pubblica (comprese le Mense Scolastiche) che prevedono nei loro punti salienti:

- Una maggiore quota di alimenti biologici (dal 40 al 50%)- Una maggior presenza di alimenti a filiera corta/km zero- Una netta riduzione di sprechi e scarti e dell’utilizzo di prodotti usa e getta

Nel pieno rispetto delle misure igieniche è possibile somministrare il pasto in classe senza scadere nelle monoporzioni e applicando i CAM dotandosi di carrelli termici. Il personale addetto allo scodellamento, opportunamente formato e dotato di guanti e mascherine, non verrebbe eliminato, ma continuerebbe a servire il pasto ai bambini in classe e in sicurezza.

Il ricorso alle monoporzioni andrebbe in deroga ai nuovi CAM appena resi Legge!

Chiediamo al Ministero dell’Istruzione e dell’Ambiente che non si adotti la soluzione del lunch box con le monoporzioni, che non venga semplificato il pasto e che non si deroghi ai nuovi CAM.

As you can imagine, this is a disaster waiting to happen.  There is no way to police who will be going in and out of the most private areas for students in the school building, locker rooms and bathrooms.

What happens when a boy or man (teacher/coach) with a penis says he identifies as a woman and is given the freedom to walk around the girls locker room naked or shower in the presence of other girls exposing his male genitalia?  Why aren’t the rights and privacy of our minor children being taken into account by this proposed policy change?

Superintendent Cates said that accommodations could be made for those students who would feel uncomfortable by the proposed policy change.  Is the district prepared to make accommodations for 11,000+ students?

Since 2015, District 211 has provided students who identify as a gender other than their biological gender the opportunity to change in private changing stalls within the locker room of their choice.  There was fierce opposition to this by both parents and students, but those voices were pushed aside at the time.  Now the envelope is being pushed even farther.

On September 19, 2019, the school board recently heard very vocal community comments against this new measure but we fear that again the voices of taxpayers and students will be silenced again and this radical policy change will take place.

Your signature on this petition says that you want the privacy of all students respected and that biological male and female students should not have open access to locker rooms and bathrooms of the opposite gender.

These are our children, now is time to speak up.  Show the Board of Education that we do not want them to be fearful of minority special interest groups, or lawsuits funded by the ACLU, but that we want them to do what’s right and protect ALL our students.  Voice your opinion and let’s make it clear that we are AGAINST the proposed policy change."

Prime MinisterRepublic of IndiaSouth BlockNew Delhi

Dear Prime Minister,

Recent pronouncements by the Government relating to Higher Education reveal the intention to slash public-funding thereby paving the way for privatization and commercialization of education in the country. Moves like the 70:30 funding formula (whereby institutions are expected to generate at least 30% of additional expenses on revision of salaries due to the 7th Pay Revision), the shift from grants to loan-based funding for infrastructure and expansion through the Higher Education Funding Agency and the push to introduce self-financing courses through the Autonomous College Scheme, forcing universities into Graded Autonomy whereby they will have the freedom to invite foreign faculty and introduce market-friendly courses are bound to have an escalating effect on the cost of education and bring down the quality. The slash in public expenditure on higher education is evident across the spectrum of IITs, IIMs, NITs, central and state universities. The CSIR too has already asked research labs to generate their own resources. Undoubtedly, this will not be beneficial for the future of science research in the country. Cuts in research grants and seats have had an adverse impact on the Research and Development initiatives in universities. The Central assistance to State Universities towards implementation of 7 Pay Revision has been drastically reduced from 80% for 5 years to 50% for 39 months.

What is shocking is that the Government has gone ahead with these plans despite opposition expressed by teachers’ associations. The 6 Bills relating to Higher Education which could not be passed through Parliament have now been brought in without discussion or consultation. Similarly, the Government has not felt the need to invite consultations with the cross-section of teachers’ and students’ bodies in universities and citizens about the Draft New Education Policy and is bringing it in through piece-meal regulations. This side lining of the highest executive body does not augur well for the future of the country.

Access to good-quality higher education is a crucial precondition for positive social change and inclusive development in a developing nation like India. If the Government promotes Privatisation and Commercialisation in higher education, it will be turning a blind eye to the enormous aspiration of the common and poor people to access higher education. Rising cost of higher education will endanger the prospects of women, the socially and economically marginalised sections and differently-abled students. These sections constitute a significant portion of India's predominantly young population. If their interests are not secured, the Government's dream of a demographic dividend will remain unrealised.

The 7th Pay Revision for teachers has ended the parity of teachers with All India Services, a demand recognised by several Pay Commissions as a means to attract talent to the teaching profession. Teachers enter the profession with higher qualifications and at a later age and hence, must be given a higher starting pay. The withdrawal of increments for PhD/ MPhil will disincentivise research. Several other conditions relating to the service conditions like the insistence on a minimum number of hours of teaching and presence in the institution without the necessary infrastructure to engage in academic work will only demotivate teachers. The recent U-turn by the Government on the Reservation Policy asking institutions to implement the roster department/ subject wise instead of taking the University/college as a unit will result in not fulfilling the Constitutional obligation of reservation of 15%, 7.5% and 27% to SCs, STs and OBCs respectively.

Most universities, even prestigious central universities like Delhi University, have failed to fill up the vacancies for permanent faculty. Majority of teachers have been working for long years on guest, temporary or ad-hoc basis despite having all the required qualifications. The best minds are seeking jobs abroad or in private-sector universities. These teachers need to be regularised in permanent jobs so that they are able to contribute to the intellectual and cultural growth of their respective institutions. Similarly, enabling promotion schemes for teachers are necessary to attract talent to the profession and keep the collective morale of teachers high; currently teachers across universities and colleges are stagnating at every level and position.

The UGC and MHRD need to provide assured funds to all institutions while, at the same time, they need to allow universities the freedom to frame their own syllabi and curricula. The Government has an important responsibility in maintaining the standards of education, but it should not trample upon academic freedom and the freedom to discuss and debate diverse ideas. Centralised syllabi and the semester-mode of teaching and examination with a cafeteria approach to courses may look attractive but it is a faulty 'one-size-fits-all' solution that disregards the diversity of learning needs and challenges across universities and colleges. The UGC has currently imposed a Choice-based Undergraduate Curriculum (CBCS) but refuses to sanction adequate teaching positions to allow universities and colleges to offer enough choices. Hence, these choices remain on paper but are never implemented in practice. Students and teachers are currently in a state of tremendous anxiety and unrest as the policy environment in higher education is hostile to in-depth teaching-learning. We urge you to ensure an open-minded, genuinely consultative approach to higher education so that the diverse educational needs of the country are taken care of.

We urge you to address the concerns outlined above so that our educational institutions are able to provide quality education and remain accessible to all the citizens of the country.

As a result of the pandemic, demand for mental health services has spiked, especially among young Australians and in regional communities. But currently, there aren’t enough mental health specialists to respond to this demand.

This is why the Australian Counselling Association is calling for registered counsellors to be included on Medicare.

Australians are waiting for months to access psychology appointments. The demand for therapy is so high that many psychologists have stopped accepting new patients altogether.

This change will give thousands of Australians access to affordable mental health care and reduce the financial impact of mental health on the economy.

While this is a nation-wide issue, it's amplified in regional and rural areas where mental health services are most lacking. The further from cities you go, the higher suicide and self-harm rates are. Almost a third of Australians live in rural and remote areas, however the majority of psychologists are employed in major cities.

We have an immediate, simple solution - over 9000 highly skilled counsellors are ready to provide their services to regional and rural communities. Counsellors are being under-utilised in the mental health workforce, despite being an appropriate and cost-effective option for Australians struggling with their mental health.

These brothers and sisters on Manus Island must see some hope. You have the rare privilege to be able to change people's lives for the better.

We urge that you fully, humanely, and correctly support maintaining the Medevac Bill, and not to vote in support of its repeal, should that come to the Senate. We know that the Government will need your support to pass a repeal of the Medevac Bill.

And we urge that you speedily implement real-life plans for the kind and appropriate resettlement of these already over-tortured brothers and sisters of ours. All of them. I appeal to your kindness, and your compassion - values that I'm sure you wish to embody.

We also recommend strongly that at last the development of humane Refugee Law go forward. Looking forward to hearing your response.

Respectfully,

Susan Wirawan, Claudio Li Calzi

P.s. Read what is the Medevac Bill and how it can help refugees.

Collins raises his hands momentarily before deciding to run. He had done nothing wrong. The officer chases him, draws his weapon, and orders Collins to raise his hands. He had done nothing wrong. According to the officer, he saw Collins draw a BB gun from his waistband. Witness testimonies dispute this. The officer shot Keith Collins four times. Collins drops but is still able to move, so the officer fires three more shots. On the ground, he continues to struggle to move, so the officer fires four more shots.

Rejoignez-nous en signant la pétition et en vous inscrivant à notre espace de travail collaboratif.

Si vous souhaitez nous suivre sur les réseaux sociaux, c'est aussi possible !

L’appel à l’origine d’Un Climat de Changement : « Non Monsieur Hulot, vous n’êtes pas seul ! »

Pour justifier sa démission, Nicolas Hulot invoque sa « solitude ». Il regrette d’être seul au gouvernement à porter l’urgence d’un changement de modèle, de ne pas avoir de parti politique, de ne pas disposer d’un mouvement populaire prêt à descendre dans la rue et à le soutenir dans sa démarche.

Pourtant, nous sommes là, conscients, et prêts.

Conscients que les impacts de l’activité humaine ont pris des proportions géologiques, que nous sommes en train de modifier de telle manière les équilibres biogéochimiques de notre planète que les conditions qui ont permis l’apparition de l’homme, et d’un grand nombre d’espèces vivantes, sont gravement menacées.

Conscients que c’est au cœur de notre modèle économique, de notre culture et de nos imaginaires qu’il faut chercher les causes de cette dérive.

Conscients que beaucoup de ce que nous tenons pour acquis, notamment en termes de confort matériel, ne peut être maintenu durablement.

Prêts à penser autrement, à imaginer d’autres façons de vivre, plus sobres, plus lentes, davantage centrées sur la nature, l’entraide, la connaissance et l’épanouissement intellectuel.

Prêts à nous mobiliser, à faire entendre plus fort le frémissement de cet avenir qui fait son chemin dans les consciences. Prêts à affronter l’ignorance, le déni ou l’égoïsme de tous ceux qui n’ont pas encore fait ce chemin.

Prêts à changer de vie, à nous détourner des sirènes de la société de consommation. Prêts à enfourcher notre bicyclette, à planter des arbres, à éteindre les lumières, à mettre des pulls l’hiver, à donner de notre temps aux autres, à accueillir ceux, d’où qu’ils viennent, qui sont jetés hors de chez eux par la guerre ou le changement climatique.

Monsieur Hulot, vous avez essayé de convaincre les « puissants ». Et vous vous êtes senti seul, au milieu des lobbyistes, des ambitieux et des technocrates. Pourtant, nous sommes là. Nous ne sommes pas (tous) militants ou zadistes, on ne nous entend pas forcément, mais nous sommes prêts à nous engager.

Ce gouvernement n’était pas assez radical pour vous. Alors soyez cohérent, soyez radical. Appelez-nous aux urnes, nous participerons. Appelez-nous dans la rue, nous nous soulèverons. Aidez-nous à nous compter, à nous mobiliser, à fédérer un mouvement citoyen à la hauteur de l’enjeu.

Aidez-nous à être ensemble, au bon endroit, pour ce rendez-vous avec l’histoire."
153,Allow users to block followers,"Like most people my age, I’m an avid user of social media. I love how easy these services have made keeping up with my family and friends, but I recently learned about a terrifying dark side: I was harassed and stalked online by an acquaintance who was able to monitor me through my social media profiles.
To protect myself, I began the process of cutting off all contact with this person, and blocking them from all of my social media accounts. That was when I discovered that Spotify only provides minimal account security and does not allow users to block others from following their activity or playlists.
That shocked me.
One of the most common scare tactics used by online stalkers is to follow and monitor their victims through social media. Even if you cut off contact, the ability for a harasser to continue following you is a form of intimidation in itself, as if they are saying, “you can’t stop me from watching you, even here.”
I do not want anyone who has been abused to be re-victimized through social media, which is why it is so important that these networks provide robust account security and the ability to easily block and report abusive followers.  That has become the standard on social media sites, and yet Spotify, the most popular music streaming service in the country, does not provide it.
When I attempted to block my harasser on Spotify, I learned that the only way I could stop them from following my activity would be to ask Spotify to delete my account (which could take 48 hours), and then reopen a new one -- and even then,that person could still find me and start following my new account. It is crazy to think that myself and millions of other people are paying for a service that is not taking our safety and security seriously, and I think it is time for that to change.

THE ISSUE IN A NUTSHELL

Our children have such severe disabilities they need the intensive, 24/7 services. Those services were provided under the state disability service system until now …

Why would the NSW Government hand over funding used to provide our children with services essential to their survival, but NOT include the provision of those same services in its agreement with the NDIA?

The NSW Government still has two buckets of money available left available to them:

They are asking us to give our children up so we can fit into bucket #2.These are much-loved children who are vulnerable and who we are constantly advocating for to keep them safe and well – we will not give them up or give up on them to fit into a bucket."
155,Protect privacy and free-speech by preventing censorship and tracking by foreign governmts,"free speech, undermine human rights or cannot guarantee the privacy and security of the data they store",['European Commission'],Hugo Santos,Portugal,3020,"May 21, 2020",https://assets.change.org/photos/1/cv/wh/NgcVwhAyCrSNTwh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1590059560,"The European Union should not allow information of its citizens to be systematically disclosed to foreign governments, since that would undermine their integrity in our always-online world.

In the last years, the amount of information stored online has increased substantially. Much of this information is of private nature to the person the information refers to, and therefore it can be used against him or her. In this way, its abuse, while not being restricted, can be, and is used, against our rights.

At the same time, governments and private organizations around the world have filtered or censored the uploaded information for their own benefit or to further advance their political or business goals.

Therefore, we, citizens of the European Union, call the European Commission (EC) to defend our rights, and create laws that ban applications and services, in any platform, that endanger free speech, undermine human rights or cannot guarantee the privacy and security of the data they store. Simultaneously, the EC should also take measures to restrict the respective owner company from accessing the European common market, while it doesn’t comply with said principles. These include information of EU citizens that could be used to undermine its integrity, as well as private conversations or personal data of any kind.

Tik Tok is one such example of this. The Cyber Security Law passed by the Government of the People’s Republic of China in 2016 forces Tik Tok and other China-based apps or whose parent companies are based in China to cede information to the Chinese Government, allowing it to impose its censorship and spread disinformation both internally and abroad.

Consequently, we ask the European Union to create and implement laws that restrict the access to the European Market of any application that:

-Threatens free speech by censoring content from its platform, either for its own benefit, the benefit of third-parties, or to appease any government or comply with political pressures.

-Is obliged, legal or extra judicially, to cede information to any government, apply censorship in or track individuals in their behalf, or in the behalf of third parties.

-Has voluntarily agreed to cede the information to any government, apply censorship or track individuals in their behalf, or in the behalf of third parties.

-Has involuntarily (e.g. trough hacking) ceded information to any government or third-party or had its content, in the same manner, subject to censorship or used to track individuals.

-It is our view that any application or service should be banned from the European Union if it fits the above criteria or if there is reasonable suspicion of such and that the ban should remain in force until the application or service no longer meets that criteria. The company behind it should also be target of legal or economic action.

We also believe that in certain situations exceptions to this should be accepted if the national security or the Universal Rights of Man could be endangered. In those situations, the sovereign governments of European Union member states should be allowed limited access to information stored online. However, the information ceded in these cases should be handled on a case by case, individualized basis.

We the undersigned firmly believe that if the bodies of the European Union take these measures and implement laws in that direction it would be in the best interest of the European Union Citizens."

I’m a mental health recovery advocate. For people like me, being hospitalised during a personal mental health crisis can be made even harder when the police or paramedics get involved. But when people call 000, that’s who gets sent out. And what happens next can have disastrous consequences. That’s why I’m calling for a Triple-0 mental health line.

We're calling on the Australian government to implement the fourth line to “000”, so when a person on the other end of the line answers, they ask “What’s your emergency - fire, police, ambulance, or mental health emergency?”

Over the last few years, we’ve come to understand that mental health in this country is in crisis, and is just as significant an issue as physical health. So why are we making paramedics or even police deal with this complex issue?

We know in Australia first-responders like police and paramedics know they are not the right people to respond to people in complex Post Trauma Stress situations, which is at the heart of so much mental illness. Mental health emergencies often take hours to resolve, the skill base is vastly different to that of a physical or forensic response, which is more about immediacy.

Even if paramedics do the job, people are just dropped off at hospital emergency departments. Often, security staff or police are called, and the whole process becomes a vicious cycle. People experiencing a mental health crisis have been tasered, or had weapons pointed at them. This immediately escalates the situation, the opposite of what that person needs.

Accessing support relies on a person's ability and resources to get to the internet in a crisis and search through websites. This is almost impossible and unfair in a crisis. The stigma of looking up and using a contact for depression or other mental illness is still very real for many communities.

This is not an unprecedented idea. To address these realities, the US has announced a “988” number direct to their national Suicide crisis support organisation. Through recent times, they've conceded police are not appropriate responders to people in suicidal or mental health crises.

A triple-0 mental health line would utilise resources that are already working well and available in many council jurisdictions in Australia, with minimal restructuring to suit the triple-0 triage system including:

1. Crises and Assessment Treatment Teams (CATT)

2. Carer networks

3. Lived experience peer networks

A national number is needed. A number that every person already knows and has immediate access to.

Add your voice to the “000” mental health emergency line."

Among the Stevens community there are countless stories of students that are walked in on while they are sleeping, changing, or generally not ready for company. In a student's leased apartment, dorm room, specialty housing, or Greek housing unit, continuous privacy should be an expectation.

Especially in female housing, these unplanned and unexpected ""boy in the house"" alerts is a disrespect to the young women on campus.

Because of this, it is not uncommon for students to not report problems within Stevens housing because of the expectation for an unwelcomed guest at an undefined time in the near future. There have also been stories of workers entering locked rooms during Stevens online career fairs during student interviews with interested companies.

In spite of numerous complaints and conversation with Facilities and Student Life departments there has been no change in procedures in reference to respecting the privacy of students. Further, while there may be some legal justification for this conduct of business, it is a shame that such a highly ranked Institution treats its students so poorly.

It is issues like these, and the lack of attention to detail that a student at Stevens does not feel valued in spite of such financial commitment, by such a profitable Institution.

Pending the outcome of this petition I urge both students and parents to consider this when choosing housing."

To date, the","['President of the United States', 'Department of Energy']",Jeffrey Barkdull,"Fresno, CA, United States",20508,27 Aug 2022,https:https://static.change.org/images/default-petition-darker.gif,"The world has had its fair share of nuclear disasters over the last half-century, including 1979 on three-mile island in Pennsylvania, the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and Fukushima, in Japan in 2011. However, few realize that another tremendous nuclear disaster is brewing elsewhere. Its location is so remote that it's no wonder you've probably never heard of it before. Five thousand miles west of Los Angeles and 500 miles north of the equator lies a small island chain known as the Marshall Islands. For many of us, these islands are best known as the birthplace of the movie monster ""Godzilla,"" who was awakened and mutated from atomic bomb explosions at one of the many islands. Sadly, the islands may never actually end up spawning a terrifying lizard that breathes radioactive fire. They may still be just as frightening in the real world, if not even more so, very soon.

The Marshall Islands are remnants of ancient volcanoes that once protruded out from this region and were first settled nearly 3,000 years ago by the ancestors of the present-day Marshallese. These people crossed the ocean by boat through Asia and Polynesia. They lived a largely secluded and peaceful existence until the mid-1940s.

During World War II, the Japanese ruled the islands until the United States showed up and took them over in 1944. Very quickly, the American presence on the islands dramatically increased. American officials were eager to find a location to test their growing atomic arsenal as the Cold War began. The vast empty expansive ocean in this region that is nearly five times the size of California seemed to be the ideal spot. In fact, between 1946 and 1958, the United States detonated a total of 67 nuclear devices across these islands, leaving all sorts of hazardous, radioactive waste behind.

The islands were even home to the biggest thermonuclear bomb ever tested by the United States government called ""Castle Bravo."" This experimental nuclear device created a mushroom cloud 4 ½ miles tall. Today, the bomb ranks as the third largest artificial explosion, equivalent to 15 megatons of TNT, making it 1,000 times as powerful as the Little Boy bomb the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima. After the explosion, it dropped radioactive ash across 7,000 square miles of the surrounding area in and around the Marshall Islands. The Marshallese were not evacuated from their islands until three days after the bomb's detonation. Many would suffer from acute radiation sickness. While the heavy fallout also contaminated twenty-three additional members of a nearby Japanese fishing vessel. The initial blast vaporized the island where the bomb went off and created a crater 2,000 meters wide by 76 meters deep.

The last nuclear bomb the United States detonated on the islands was in 1958. Shortly afterward, the world began understanding the implications of sustained above-ground atomic testing. That is why in 1963, a treaty was signed amongst most of the world's nations that banned nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater, which still stands today. However, as far as the Marshall Islands were concerned, the U.S. had already done the damage.

All of this nuclear testing came at another horrible long-term price. That's because it also left behind an incredible amount of hazardous, radioactive waste. The United States government knew that it had to do something to clean its mess. As a result, they built a giant tomb to store all of this radioactive debris in the 1970s. They built it here on one of the most isolated islands in the chain called Runit. The tomb was built over an enormous existing crater from a previous nuclear test and kept off with a massive concrete dome to seal the harmful contents forever. The dome is 115 meters wide and 18 inches thick. Today, the tomb contains about 3.1 million cubic feet or 35 Olympic-sized swimming pools of nuclear waste. However, it doesn't just include all the nuclear waste that America generated on the Marshall Islands. The U.S. government also sent over 130 tons of radioactive soil and atomic debris from nuclear test sites in Nevada and threw all that into the tomb to join the Marshall Island debris. The tomb on Runit Island became one of America's largest storage sites for nuclear waste. While it's located over 7,000 miles from Washington, DC, it's only 665 miles from the Marshall Islands' capital city, Majuro.

The tomb's construction effort took three years to complete with the help of 4,000 U.S. service members. Six men died from acute radiation poisoning during the construction, and hundreds developed radiation-linked cancers from handling the hazardous wastes. All that dangerous waste includes all sorts of radiated equipment, soil, and plutonium lease chunks of concrete and metal. One particular isotope of plutonium housed inside the tomb, Plutonium-239, has a half-life of 24,100 years, which means it will take 24,100 years for the material to lose half of its radioactivity. However, what's even worse is that during the construction, the government failed to build a concrete lining underneath the dome and instead just relied upon the existing crater itself. As a result, seawater has slowly begun seeping into the tomb from the Pacific Ocean surrounding it. After it seeps in, it'll leak and take radioactive waste into the Pacific. Now, the Marshallese have to maintain a decades-old decaying structure while worrying about the future of what was once a pristine place. It's even more alarming when you remember that the world's climate is changing rapidly, and the ocean sea levels are rising. The Marshall Islands, in particular, face a graver threat from this than most other places.

In fact, since 1993, the sea levels within the Marshall Islands region have risen by about 0.3 inches per year. Based on forecasted sea levels, this could reach up to 4 or 5 additional feet by the end of this century alone. That's within our lifetimes and would effectively submerge most of these islands for good and the tomb itself. Potentially even collapsing the dome and releasing all of that incredible amount of radioactive waste inside. Since the tomb is already somewhat bobbing up and down with the tides today, it could present itself as a complete disaster scenario. Today, thousands of dead fish are washing up on the shore regularly due to the terrible radioactive waste already leaking into the surrounding water. The nuclear tomb on Runit Island has the potential to become one of the 21st century's greatest nuclear disasters.

So, you may ask, what is being done about all of this? Well, fortunately, we can report some progress. For instance, in 2020, [the National Defense Authorization Act/the U.S. bill that funds the U.S. military each year] mandated that [the Department of Energy/the Department in charge of the United States nuclear arsenal] conduct a report on the Runit dome's status. In that report, they determined that it's not in any immediate danger of collapse or failure. Even so, it remains to be seen if this will continue to be true over the next few decades, particularly if sea levels rise enough to submerge the dome.

As far as the Marshallese are concerned, however, much of the Marshall Islands are already uninhabitable due to the region's sizeable radioactive hazard. It has been reported that some islands are even more radioactive than Chernobyl. Around 650 residents live on only three of the 40 or so primary islands in the Atoll where Runit is located are unsafe for human habitation. The unfortunate fact is that the Marshallese don't have the capability or the funding to deal with this issue alone. They have to instead rely entirely upon America's willingness to clean up the mess they left behind for good. To date, the nuclear claims tribunal — an independent arbiter established by the U.S.-Marshall Islands compact to process and rule on claims — has ruled in their favor, awarding them more than $2 billion in damages. But the U.S. has paid out only $4 million, according to congressional testimony, and no enforcement mechanism exists.

In the last few years, the island nation’s claims have become more visible.

President Heine has achieved near-celebrity status at international events. The Marshall Islands recently secured a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council, giving the nation another forum in which to raise its concerns.

A geopolitical shift also has given the islands new leverage. China has increased its reach into the central Pacific, providing aid and loans to dozens of nations, surpassing the United States as its largest trade partner.

“China is trying to erode U.S. influence in the region to weaken the U.S. military presence and create an opening for Chinese military access,” according to a 2018 report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional committee.

In September, two of the United States staunchest allies in the Pacific — Kiribati and the Solomon Islands — severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan, embracing (Communist) China instead.

Washington has greeted those developments with concern.

In August, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo flew to Micronesia to meet with the leaders of several Pacific island nations, including the Marshall Islands.

He announced the United States' intention to extend the compact with the Marshall Islands — providing aid in exchange for a secure military presence and working rights for Marshallese in the United States.

The announcement came as a surprise to the Marshallese, who were anticipating the expiration in 2023 of their compact, which includes annual grants from the U.S. that total about $30 million a year.

Marshallese officials read that as a sign that the islands have new negotiating power.

“These are matters of life and death for us,” said Jack Ading, the Enewetak senator. “We can’t afford to rely exclusively on reassurances from one source. We need neutral experts from the international community to weigh in, to confirm or challenge” previous U.S. findings.

Many Marshallese say they don’t want U.S. money or apologies but just a home in the Marshall Islands that is safe and secure.

Nerje Joseph holds out hope for a day when her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren can return to her ancestral home in Rongelap, and she can be buried in the sands of her youth, alongside her ancestors, under the coconut trees she remembers so well.

“In Los Angeles, you make movies about the Titanic. About people who lost everything,” she said.

“Why don’t you make movies about us?”

Well, it remains to be seen whether a more permanent solution to holding in the waste will come about or if this will become the world's next great nuclear disaster in the making because if the Runit dome deteriorates, all of its Radioactive poison will empty into the sea and will likely cause negative consequences beyond its borders. Whatever the future might hold for the fate of the dome on Runit Island, it takes time to learn how to solve or overcome any challenge."

I grew up loving the game of football. As often as possible, I’d watch the matches on television with family and friends, cheering on our favorite teams and players. But as a woman in Iran, I’ve never seen a single game played in my home country.

Iran's largest stadium is named Azadi - which means ""freedom"" - and it seats 100,000 sports fans. However, not one of those seats is currently designated for Iranian women to freely enjoy sports.

Please sign my petition demanding FIFA use its power to call for an end to Iran’s stadium ban for women. Help me raise 100,000 signatures to represent the 100,000 seats of Azadi Stadium. UPDATE: We have surpassed 500,000! Help us reach 1,000,000!!

Women are passionate sports fans just like men, and deserve to cheer on their teams in the stadiums. The fact that this discriminatory ban has existed for 39 years is appalling, and an assault on our right to free assembly. But the good news is that it’s not actually written into our law, and can easily be overturned – if we apply enough pressure on the right people.

Iran is the only country playing in the 2018 World Cup which bans women from stadiums, a direct violation of FIFA’s gender discrimination statute and their new human rights policy. Yet FIFA president Gianni Infantino has shown no sign of doing anything about it – in fact, he was recently photographed posing with Iranian president Rouhani the day after 35 women were arrested for attempting to attend a football game.

Sign my petition to demand that Mr. Infantino use his power to get Iran to end the stadium ban for women. Support #NoBan4Women. Thank you!

We should not be taking public transit at this time (as we can’t guarantee that we will get to work on time and for the public’s safety incase we are exposed at work). Many healthcare workers are parking off hospital property to save money, however, this poses a risk as well, such as our safety and security. Many workers are coming outside to be assaulted and/or to find their cars vandalized, towed and ticketed due to parking in unsafe areas or being parked too long in certain areas due to being mandated/ staying longer at the patients bedside to care for acute patients in need.

European Union and United Nations calls for a global shift to a vegan diet to survive hunger, poverty and climate change- Unión Europea y Naciones Unidas hacen llamamiento a un cambio global hacia una dieta vegana para sobrevivir a la hambruna, a la pobreza y al cambio climático



The objective is to promote, once again, the idea that the production and consumption of the body of the animals should be abolished. The demand for abolition of meat is the logical consequence of vegetarianism or veganism. People who are against the bull, for example., Do not just ask the public to boycott bullfights: demand that they be prohibited. Campaigners against foie gras do not just ask people not to buy it: they want the forced feeding of geese is prohibited. Because those who are opposed to the flesh are the only individual to be confined to giving advice? From the point of view of movement, refusing to eat meat can be regarded as a political boycott, as an expression of individual support abolition. In Britain, the late 18 th century, during the movement for the abolition of slavery, 300 thousand people boycotted sugar produced by slaves on plantations. The movement for the abolition of meat expresses a political approach: its purpose is to bring the public to subscribe to the idea that meat should be banned. The goal is that human societies, one after the other, they decide to ban the production, sale and consumption of meat. The idea is to claim loud and clear that not only has the responsibility of each individual to stop supporting the murderous exploitation requested by the consumption of animal bodies and ""animal derivatives"", but that is also, therefore, a duty of any society as a whole to declare In favor of the ban on the rearing, fishing and hunting.

Universal Declaration of Animal Rights

Preamble:

Considering that Life is one, all living beings having a common origin and having diversified in the course of the evolution of the species, - Considering that all living beings possess natural rights, and that any animal with a nervous system has specific rights,

Considering that the contempt for, and even the simple ignorance of, these natural rights, cause serious damage to Nature and lead men to commit crimes against animals,

Considering that the coexistence of species implies a recognition by the human species of the right of other animal species to live,

Considering that the respect of animals by humans is inseparable from the respect of men for each other,

It is hereby proclaimed that:

Article 1

All animals have equal rights to exist within the context of biological equilibrium. This equality of rights does not overshadow the diversity of species and of individuals.

3°- A dead animal must be treated with decency.

Article 4

1°- Wild animals have the right to live and to reproduce in freedom in their own natural environment.

2°- The prolonged deprivation of the freedom of wild animals, hunting and fishing practised as a pastime, as well as any use of wild animals for reasons that are not vital, are contrary to this fundamental right.

2°-Replacement methods must be developed and systematically implemented.

Article 7

Any act unnecessary involving the death of an animal, and any decision leading to such an act, constitute a crime against life.

Article 8

1°- Any act compromising the survival of a wild species and any decision leading to such an act are tantamount to genocide, that is to say, a crime against the species.

2°- The massacre of wild animals, and the pollution and destruction of biotopes are acts of genocide.

Article 9

1°- The specific legal status of animals and their rights must be recognised by law.

2°- The protection and safety of animals must be represented at the level of Governmental organizations.

Article 10

Educational and schooling authorities must ensure that citizens learn from childhood to observe, understand and respect animals.

The Universal Declaration of Animal Rights was solemnly proclaimed in Paris on 15 October 1978 at the UNESCO headquarters.

The text, revised by the International League of Animal Rights in 1989, was submitted to the UNESCO Director General in 1990 and made public that same year.



PREMESSA

10 Moltiplicando il consumo pro capite di diversi alimenti in USA (colonna A) per i pounds di grano e soia necessari per la produzione di un pound di ciascuno di essi (colonna B) possiamo determinare il numero di pound di grano e soia necessari a produrre manzo, pollo e latticini consumati mediamente da un americano nell'arco di un anno (colonna C):



I II III

Manzo 73 16 1168

Maiale 59 6 354

Tacchino 15 4 60

Pollo 63 3 189

Uova 34 3 102

Latticini 603 1 603

1 pound al giorno di grano o una combinazione di grano e soia nutrono adeguatamente una persona per un anno. Dividendo la somma del grano e della soia consumati mediamente in un anno da un americano che si alimenta con carne e formaggi (2568 pound), per il grano e la soia necessari a nutrire un individuo per un anno (365 pound) scopriamo che 7 persone potrebbero nutrirsi con l'equivalente di quello che mangia un americano carnivoro (2568 / 365 = 7.04).



Questo scenario si basa sulla stima che il peso del bestiame viene determinato dalla quantita' di grano e soia consumata . Una porzione di carne e formaggio viene prodotta alimentando gli animali anche con il foraggio dei pascoli, ma nonostante cio', tra il 1979 e il 1988 ogni animale e' stato nutrito mediamente con 4680 pound di grano e soia (Ag. Stats. 1989; tables 74 and 75). Mentre a qualche livello la produzione di carne e latticini puo' risultare sostenibile alimentando gli animali col pascolo, la recente abitudine di utilizzare a questo scopo grandi quantita' di grano e soia provoca danni insostenibili all'ambiente.

This was detrimental to my GPA and caused me to only be able to qualify for one scholarship that does not even cover a quarter of the costs to get an education. I want to be able to provide resources to all communities so no one has to struggle mentally like I did in high school. TikTok claims to be all about inclusivity but fails to include those involved in the mental health community.

We came to be known as the Wilmington Ten.   The District Attorney, Jay Stroud, actively sought to exclude black people from the jury. In his trial notes, which have recently come to light, he marked black potential jurors, and wrote, ""stay away from black men."" In another note he writes, ""probably KKK good."" BUt he wasn't opposed to every black person sitting on the jury; he mentions that one potential juror is a ""sensible, Uncle Tom type.""   Every one of the trial's main witnesses against us -- convicted felons -- later recanted their testimony. A newly released letter shows that one of them asked Stroud for special favors in return for testifying against us.   My biggest aspiration at the time was to create an educational environment conducive to the needs of ALL students in Wilmington. For that ""crime"" the ten of us were plucked from our families and from our futures. Years I would have spent in law school working to fulfill my dream of becoming a lawyer and a politician were instead spent in prison, or fighting false charges against me. Years my friends would have spent raising their children and pursuing their own dreams were instead simply lost.   Sometimes, when a dream is deferred for long enough, you don't get to start from the beginning. I may not ever become an attorney or a politician. But Governor Bev Perdue can help set the record straight once and for all, and in doing so free the surviving Wilmington Ten members from the air of suspicion and lifetime of discrimination that has followed us ever since we were falsely convicted.   Please join me in asking Governor Perdue to look carefully at all the evidence, and close this ugly chapter in North Carolina's history by issuing pardons of innocence for the six surviving and 4 deceased members of The Wilmington Ten.The Wilmington Ten Pardons of Innocence Project

184,Make Brussels Public Transport safer for Women,it? I should be able to use public transport and I shouldn't feel terrified and have to pay a,"['Annelies Verlinden', 'Philippe Close']",Charlotte D,"Brussels, Belgium",1522,16 Dec 2021,https://assets.change.org/photos/7/yo/ae/mDyOAeOTBNUnlhA-800x450-noPad.jpg?1639672944,"I was assaulted and robbed at Brussels Midi Station on 14th December, Tuesday evening at around 11pm. The police were too ‘under-staffed’ to go across the road and take action against the perpetrator. Many of us are scared to travel in our own city. These crimes may be viewed as petty by the police and government, but they are traumatising and stay with us.

As a woman commuting on my own I am asking for two key things in this petition:

The state of Midi and North station in Brussels as we all know, is terrible. Too many of us feel unsafe in these stations and too many attacks are ignored. In a few hours of sharing my story I’ve received hundreds of messages from women sending me their own very dark and similar stories in stations throughout Brussels. What seems too common: Police often reacting with the same ‘sorry we are under-staffed’. I have pinpointed women in the title as indeed, it is mainly women who have reached out over the same concerns. Naturally, we are an easier target. The stations are sweeping and very large in size, a hotspot for criminal behaviour. Culprits lurk in corners, unmanned, preying on their next victim (apparently with no repercussions). Our stations turn into lawless jungles at night and it is not acceptable to brush off violent behaviour. We need a crackdown on violence in these stations. As a woman, it is especially unsafe and that shouldn't be OK with our politicians. I have a commute to make and sure, I can take an Uber, but that's not really a fair fix for this problem, is it? I should be able to use public transport and I shouldn't feel terrified and have to pay a premium to get around.The stats: According to a report commissioned by interior minister Annelies Verlinden...In 2016 Criminal acts committed in our train stations: 3,902 In 2019 Criminal acts in Brussels stations had risen to: 7,942I don't have the statistics for 2021, but I would bet it follows the same harrowing pattern... the situation is already out of hand.

According to The Brussels Times, BNP Paribas Fortis actually employed bodyguards to accompany staff to and from Brussels North station due to complaints of an unsafe environment. Bank spokesperson Hilde Junius explained “Several of our colleagues no longer feel safe in recent weeks, which is why we are now deploying security staff. There are concerns loiterers who also make comments, especially to our female colleagues, which makes them feel threatened”. This highlights just how dire the safety situation is. It is beyond disappointing that we have reached a stage where organisations are compelled to provide security for employees to travel to and from work.Quoting a friend who came to my aid that night in Midi: ""the station looked like a scene from a horror movie, a drugged man with a bloody face attacking people, pools of blood on the floor, sinister drunken characters looking for their next victim and screams coming from all corners of the station"".This is the capital of Europe, and that is the state of our main central stations in Brussels. What a welcome... can't we do better?Below you can read my story.

I screamed for what felt like around a minute as I was cornered after being followed through the barriers to the metro by (what seemed to be) a drug crazed man with saliva dripping all over his face (he was not wearing a mask). Initially, people continued to go down escalators across the way and didn’t come to help me as he cornered me against the wall. I understand they may be scared to endanger themselves, but there are more ways you can help when you hear someone scream, than just carrying on with your day. Grab someone to get help, call the police. Do something, as long as it’s not nothing.

I could have been more seriously harmed and I’m lucky it was only some ripped clothing, a bruise and a cracked phone screen. I’m well aware it could have been more sinister and in a way, I’m actually lucky.

I persisted in screaming as loud and as long as I could hoping the attacker would stop touching me, or some police would arrive. It just didn’t seem to be happening and I was starting to run out of energy - that was the scariest moment. Eventually people realised the haunting noise of my screams was not a joke and something sinister was taking place. They started to arrive to help me and some men managed to retrieve my mobile from the attacker after a short chase down the escalator.

After the attack I went to the police, filed a report. The police were aware that the man was still in the station (just across the road) but they said they were too understaffed to send anyone over to pick him up. Quite alarming isn’t it? It seemed like fires needed putting out all over the station. Guards were run off their feet with criminality on different platforms. However, there didn’t seem to be one police officer in the station that night.

It was startling how violent the station was that night and multiple attacks took place.

To be blunt, it felt like a waste of time reporting it. It felt like that terrible man was just going to get away with it. I’m sure there’s CCTV, but I’m doubtful the man will be caught, which is a scary thought for me. These crimes may be viewed as petty by the government and police, but they are actually quite traumatising and can have a long-lasting effect on your day to day.

I want a crackdown on this type of criminality. I want it to be taken more seriously. By leaving these acts of violence unpunished, you are in fact enabling more violent behaviour. If criminal behaviour is not tackled in these stations, it will continue to worsen and multiply, as is becoming the case. This is unacceptable.

There’s some lessons I would encourage us all to learn or refresh on here:

1. If you hear a woman screaming, it’s most likely not a joke. Again - do something, as long as it’s not nothing. You could make a difference and save a life, stop a person from becoming a statistic or save them a darker trauma. If it ends up being you one day which you never think it will, you’ll rely on likeminded people to lean on in your moment of need, and believe me, you’re going to hope they turn up for you too.2. Certain stations aren’t safe in Brussels after a certain time of night, until we see more action taken, girls in particular - please take an Uber or trusted taxi because there are not enough police around for us to feel protected. Sad but true. The point of this petition indeed, is to apply pressure to change the current situation.3. Download a rape alarm app. Take a self defence class, do what you can within your control to be better equipped. I’m not sure to this point if screaming was the right thing to do. It could have angered my attacker and he could have ended up ‘quieting me’ so to put it, but in this case people eventually turned up because of my screams. It’s a gamble and you’re fight or flight will take over and your responses probably won’t fit with your plan of action anyway, but give it some thought for future, do what you can.

If more is not done, the list of victims like myself will grow longer. As it grows longer, we will inevitably grow louder. We don't feel safe commuting in this city and it's up to you to improve our safety. I urge for stronger police presence and stronger retaliation to crimes of this nature. I'm sorely disappointed that police were not able to help me more.

Thank you in advance for all of your support, I’m overwhelmed by the reaction so far. I will not stop until I feel more safe in this city and see change.

I want better from the city I call home. Please make my commute safer!

PS, If the lovely gentleman that stayed with me until help came reads this, or any of the men who intervened for that matter… I’m eternally grateful, thank you so much. I will forever appreciate your actions that night."

Most women will agree that even an ordinary gynaecological examination - at the best of times and with the best of doctors - can make one feel uncomfortable, helpless and vulnerable in revealing intimate details and submitting to intrusive examinations.

The reality is that thousands of Indian women are forced to submit to insensitive, disrespectful & callous treatment from their doctors. Their rights to privacy, dignity and choices are blatantly trampled upon, in having to submit to male gynaecologists against their choice and in not being given the choice of making informed decisions regarding their treatment.

Many of these horrifying abuses are documented in news reports, but with no response either from policy-makers or from professional bodies.

·       Forced sterilisations of uninformed and unwilling women in health camps lacking in privacy, unhygienic conditions, most often by men gynaecologists, in the name of well being of women, without preoperative counselling or post operative care.

·       Unnecessary caesarian sections and procedures carried out without taking consent of women

·       Abuse, mistreatment and violence against women in labour.

·       Mistreatment and humiliation of survivors of rape and sexual violence

It is not only poor women who are subjected to these violations.  Recently, a good friend of mine, a successful professional went to a woman gynaecologist for her perimenopausal issues, and was advised diagnostic D& C to determine the right line of treatment.

To her utter shock, just before she was knocked unconscious, she realized that a male doctor had been brought in to carry out the procedure on her, an aspect which was absolutely mortifying for her and she had made her discomfort very clear to her doctor earlier.  When she came to, she got to know that in addition, an invasive surgery, complete uterine ablation which is burning of uterus lining with current, (leading to sterilization) had been performed on her along with insertion of a hormone eluding intrauterine device. Doctors she consulted later revealed that the procedure was an outdated one and was no longer the treatment of choice as it is loaded with complications and side effects. She was snubbed when she questioned  this doctor, who told her she knew what was good for her and she should be grateful for the therapeutic treatment.. The experience has left her raped and violated – very deeply traumatised. Any justice she tries to seek will be more draining and humiliating for her.

She is an educated, aware woman, who likes to take informed decisions regarding her body and life, choosing to live in the most natural manner. Yet, her rights were completely trampled upon, forcing her into a long struggle to recover physically, mentally and psychologically, quietly!

Her experience is a wake up call that the system needs to change!

My campaign is to call on the policy makers in the country to lay down clear and stringent standards for the examination, treatment and care of women patients, in the form of detailed written consent forms. Any violations should lead to harsh punishments.

The minimum standards should include

·       The right to be treated by a doctor of one’s choice (including the right to be treated by a woman doctor.)

·       Right to full information on her condition, its implications, the available treatments and their possible side effects.

·       The right to take a second opinion before opting for treatment, and the right to refuse treatment.

·       The right to privacy, confidentiality and bodily dignity during examination and treatment, especially when the patient is unconscious.

·       Any photography or videography during treatment or while unconscious, whether for educational or other purposes should be absolutely banned without informed & written consent of the patient.

This campaign also seeks to start a conversation to -

1.     Educate & empower women about their rights as a human being.

2.     Need to sensitise the medical fraternity that the women patients are to be treated with respect as the doctors would want their own bodies to be treated. Not as objects or animals.

3.     Gynae procedures need to be evaluated in terms of their safety and benefit and use of non invasive methods for general reproductive cycle of a woman should be encouraged. Right now, invasive procedures are carried out so easily on women, mutilating their natural systems as if women’s bodies are intrinsically flawed.

4.    Society recognises many gender specific jobs, say female nurses for female patients, female security staff for frisking of women at airports or building entries, carried out in the privacy of a curtained cubicle, and men staff for men, women constables for women protesters or criminals. Recognising the need even public transport, cab service etc. is being looked into specifically for women, with women drivers & attendants.

It is high time Gynaecological service for the normal reproductive cycle of women’s health, is recognised as a highly gender specific domain. Why is it expected that a woman should be comfortable getting her private parts, exposed, examined and handled by men in an absolutely undignified posture? Private parts are private and for most gynae requirements, there is no emergency situation.

The right to privacy, right to bodily integrity and bodily autonomy, needs to be respected in this very basic medical requirements of a woman's normal life cycle."

The recent murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade and so many others have sparked widespread awareness of the long-standing injustices against Black people in this country since 1619.

We are a group composed of Yorktown Central School District (YCSD) students, alumni, parents, and community members who believe that YCSD must fully confront the 400+ years of racial injustice and oppression enacted upon Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) in the United States. Yorktown students must graduate with a thorough understanding of the ingrained institutional and systemic racism that prevails in our country today.

We applaud the strides that YCSD has made in confronting sensitive issues in recent years, such as the creation of the Husker Discovery program and the increased emphasis on teaching empathy and kindness to students. However, we believe that the district must devote more time and resources to specifically and directly address contemporary racial justice issues.

Therefore, we call on YCSD to implement the following:

1. Form a diverse committee of administrators, teachers, students, parents, alumni and other active community members to spearhead racial justice education and ensure racial equity in our schools. This committee should be responsible for acting as a liaison between the district and the community. Plans, timelines, and progress on accomplishing the following points should be shared with the greater community in the spirit of transparency and accountability.

2. Revise and expand the existing anti-racism curriculum for grades K-12 to address topics such as racial identity, the contemporary history of race relations in America (post-1965), and ongoing systemic and institutional racial issues. This curriculum should be interdisciplinary and especially prominent in English and social studies classes. In English classes, students should be assigned more texts directly related to systemic racism, allyship, and activism. In social studies classes, teachers should directly address issues like privilege, police brutality, redlining, mass incarceration, and the continuous oppression of the Indigenous population. The district should introduce regularly scheduled assemblies and workshops with qualified speakers for grades K-12 to address issues of systemic racism.

3. Be a district of upstanders against racial injustice. The district should stand in solidarity with BIPOC, by releasing statements of acknowledgment and support for affected communities when public incidences of racial injustice occur. Furthermore, the district must take a preventative stance against both overt and covert racism within the Yorktown community.

4. Diversify the teaching and administrative faculty. The district should specifically aim to hire more BIPOC teachers and administrators. The district must make a public commitment to improve minority representation, and demographic data of faculty composition should be made available to the Yorktown community on an annual basis.

5. Mandate extensive diversity, inclusion, sensitivity and unconscious bias training for faculty and staff. Training should include topics on race and minority empowerment and should be administered by reputable, vetted organizations.

Numerous school districts across the country and within Westchester County are being asked to implement large-scale changes to improve education addressing racial injustice and inequality. We ask that the district proactively confront issues of racism and injustice. We cannot be afraid to talk about racism in America. Conversations about race and racial injustice are best introduced at a young age to foster empathy. As our students enter adulthood, we need to equip them with the ability to have mature conversations about difficult topics.

By equipping Yorktown students with the resources needed to critically engage in ongoing conversations about racial inequality, we empower students to enact positive change in their communities and fulfill the YCSD mission of creating “competent, contributing, and compassionate world citizens.”

We, the signatories of this letter, are calling on YCSD to enact upon the aforementioned demands. We recognize and commend the actions that YCSD has taken thus far, and acknowledge that individual teachers are making efforts to discuss racial injustice in their classrooms. However, we must combat racial inequality and systemic racism through a standardized and united district-wide commitment to keep these issues at the forefront of the YCSD curriculum.

We need Pakistani experts on climate change to come together and influence policies that are meant to be effective for Pakistan exclusively. No Western country is on the top 10 affectees.

Geography has always fascinated me. Volcanoes, globalisation, development, you name it. It’s the one subject that has left me with the desire to find out more. In fact, it inspired me enough to realise that not only is the earth a beautiful place, but one that is in desperate need of our help. More importantly, it inspired me to get out there and do as much as I could.

Climate change is the most pressing and threatening issue to modern day society. Through lack of understanding from generations before us, we are having to fix it. And how can we do this without education? However, yet again, our government - part of the generation who bear more responsibility for this problem intend to not only fail to act on climate change themselves, but to obscure the truth, and any chance we have of acting from children and young people. It is outrageous that Michael Gove can even consider the elimination of climate change education for under 14s. We must keep climate change in our curriculum in order for young people to be as skilled and informed to take on this challenge as we are taking it on today.

Unfortunately, this takes away the potential in the adults of tomorrow to take a stand to cease the loss of their future. Personally, the one thing that inspired me enough to get involved were my Geography lessons. I was able to understand the many issues surrounding climate change, the many perspectives. The beauty of Geography is the fact that it enables us to express frankly the problems earth and humanity faces, without hiding the truth, yet this change is removing the power that it currently possesses. I began to realise that it wasn’t fair that people in my situation were inadvertently causing harm to people less well off due to our own carelessness. I began to realise that it was my responsibility.

Il 25 ottobre scorso, proseguendo nella linea imposta dal BlackRock, la Borsa di New York ha deciso di aprire una nuova classe di attivi finanziari, gestiti da una nuova categoria d’imprese le “Natural Assets Companies” (NAC), una vera e propria monetizzazione generale della natura sotto tutela della Borsa, per comprarsi pezzi di Pianeta da cui estrarre profitti. Se questa appropriazione finanziaria privata della natura non sarà arrestata, l'acqua e l'insieme del mondo naturale, saranno totalmente, in pochi anni, nelle mani di ristretti gruppi finanziari.

Dalla messa dell’acqua in Borsa, che ha sancito la finanziarizzazione di un bene essenziale e drammaticamente scarso, assoggettandone la disponibilità alla logica di mercato e di profitto, nulla è cambiato e nessun passo indietro è stato compiuto.

Scarsità per taluni, è ricchezza per altri secondo il dogma liberista.

Nel mentre 2,2 miliardi di persone non hanno ancora un accesso minimo vitale all’acqua potabile e 3,4 miliardi non dispongono di servizi igienici di base, cosa fa la finanza? Interviene pesantemente per “governare” la penuria idrica ed assicurare così, grazie ad un prezzo speculativo, anzitutto la disponibilità dell’acqua alle imprese private grandi utilizzatrici e produttrici di profitto. Uno scandalo!

Sottoporre l’acqua alla speculazione finanziaria apre a scenari ancora peggiori che, inevitabilmente, porteranno all’emarginazione di territori, popolazioni, piccoli agricoltori e piccole imprese, aggravando la crisi globale ecosistemica, climatica, economica, sociale e sanitaria.

E’ urgente una svolta globale innovativa in tutela dell’acqua e dell’ambiente ed in difesa beni comuni della Terra essenziali per la vita di tutti,.

Per il Relatore Onu Arrojo-Agudo, la crisi dell’acqua trae origine da due fallimenti:

• Il primo è l’insostenibilità che abbiamo determinato a danno dei nostri ecosistemi acquatici, trasformando l’acqua nel più pericoloso vettore di malattie e morte mai conosciuto al mondo.

• Il secondo ha a che fare con le diseguaglianze e la povertà, prodotte da un sistema socio-economico “immorale” che ha privatizzato e sottomesso tutto alle sragionevoli ed inumane “leggi del mercato” e della speculazione borsistica (le leggi del più forte).

L’acqua è la madre di tutti i diritti: la sua quotazione in borsa renderà vana, nei fatti, la fondamentale risoluzione dell’Assemblea Generale dell’ONU del 2010 sul diritto universale all’acqua. Inoltre, nel nostro paese rappresenterà un ulteriore schiaffo al voto di 27 milioni di cittadine/i italiane/i che nel 2011 si espressero nel referendum dicendo che l’acqua doveva uscire dal mercato e che non si poteva fare profitto su questo bene.

Per questo esigiamo dai poteri pubblici italiani, decisioni prioritarie

1. Che vengano immediatamente vietate le transazioni finanziarie sull’acqua;

2. Il divieto alle società di gestione dei servizi idrici di essere quotate in Borsa: zero Borsa per l’acqua bene comune e servizio pubblico mondiale;

3. Che si rigetti la monetizzazione della natura e venga riconosciuto il diritto dei fiumi, mari, laghi, ghiacciai e loro ecosistemi, di esistere in quanto tali, come beni universali della vita. Il valore della vita non è il prezzo;

4. Che venga formalmente stralciato l'art. 6 dal Ddl Concorrenza che mette in discussione alla base la funzione pubblica e sociale dei Comuni, costringendoli di fatto al ruolo di enti unicamente deputati a mettere sul mercato i servizi pubblici di propria titolarità, con grave pregiudizio dei propri doveri di garanti dei diritti della comunità di riferimento;

5. Che si sleghi l’agroalimentare dalla logica del profitto, incentivando le produzioni vegetali e locali che abbisognano di meno acqua rispetto a quelle zootecniche e favorendo così un utilizzo razionale e responsabile delle risorse idriche a fini alimentari.

In aggiunta, invitiamo i cittadini ad agire affinché:

• il principio “chi inquina paga” venga sostituito dal principio “è vietato inquinare”;

• si crei il Consiglio mondiale dei cittadini per la comune sicurezza idrica della Terra e la costituzione dell’Assemblea Mondiale dell’Acqua;

• siano intraprese azioni legali contro gli Stati che non salvaguardano e non garantiscono la rigenerazione delle acque, della vita, e lasciano alla monetizzazione della natura l’impostura della protezione del mondo naturale;

• venga messa fine al Capitalismo predatorio di terre ed altre risorse del pianeta;

•  Che venga promosso, anche in concorso con gli enti locali, l'avvio di una discussione pubblica sul ruolo dei Comuni, dei servizi pubblici, dei beni comuni e della democrazia di prossimità dentro un contesto di ripensamento del modello sociale dettato dalla necessità di affrontare la diseguaglianza sociale e la crisi climatica, evidenziate dalla pandemia;

• Nuova tariffazione dei servizi idrici: la tariffa non deve prevedere profitti né remunerazione del capitale in alcuna forma. Garantire ad ogni cittadino il quantitativo minimo vitale (50 l/g/ab) stabilendo che sia a carico della fiscalità generale. L‘acqua è da tempo ridotta a merce e ora è trattata come un avere finanziario su cui speculare.

Council has passed a Climate Emergency motion - now we need action.

Even with careful recycling, all plastic waste - even recycled plastic - ends up in landfill. Because of ""Downcycling"" all plastic can only be recycled a maximum 2-3 times before it becomes unusable.

So what if we can't recycle our way to Zero Waste?

While we wait for alternatives, we still need plastic - for health etc - and we will be left with huge volumes of plastic buried in the ground.

Residents of the Northern Beaches want Council to look at all options that could reduce un-recylable plastic and other waste currently buried in landfill sites.

This includes waste-to-energy technology that is non-incineration so there are no emissions - and Northern Beaches Council could lead the way on evaluating the feasibility of this new clean energy technology.

The proposal is simply for Council to seek funding from the Commonwealth Government, so there is no cost to local rate payers - in fact it could save money!

The Northern Beaches resource recovery centre at Kimbriki currently collects about 490m3 of gas per hour, which is about 52% methane and this methane is then simply flared off. Turning large volumes of highly polluting methane into less polluting CO2 is not a strategy for reducing emissions.

The local community wants to investigate how our dangerous landfill methane and un-recyclable plastic and other waste materials could be converted into electricity as part of genuine local circular economy.

We want to see Council at least conduct a study into the potential of modular non-incineration waste-to-energy technology as a solution to the problem that we face from non-recyclable plastics and landfill methane.

We have the opportunity to reduce dangerous local emissions and to reduce rates and fees, and generate revenue for Council to support local charities, clubs and services.

Why wouldn't we at least consider the options?"

198,Funded IVF for Same Sex Couples in England,"In England, in a same sex relationship you need to have around 6 failed cycles of IVF or IUI before getting one funded attempt on the NHS. In a heterosexual relationship, you get an attempt for free if you meet certain criteria. In Wales, ALL females regardless of sexuality get 2 attempts on the NHS. In Scotland, ALL females get 3 free attempts on the NHS. In Northern Ireland, ALL females get 1 attempt. You catch my drift here, it’s about time England caught up and offered same sex females equal rights. 
I didn’t choose to be gay, but because I am, we have had to pay up to £6,000 per IVF cycle and around £1,500 for an embryo transfer. That’s not including the cost of donor sperm and drugs. The fertility process isn’t an easy one and this can be quite costly and often result in same sex couples not having children because of the financial implications. I am not starting this petition to make a change for us, we are lucky that we have one amazing little girl. But I am hoping that we can change things for hundreds of couples going through this process in the future. We deserve to have the same rights as other females, regardless of our sexuality. 
We understand that it is not easy to make this happen overnight and we are aware of the work and effort it takes to make extensive changes in England. Here are the specific objectives we want our decision-makers to reach to make sure this campaign gets to victory:
1 - Bring this issue to parliament to be discussed with experts on fertility and answer why England has stricter rules than Wales (2 attempts), Northern Ireland (1 attempt), Scotland (3 attempts). We want to know why England's NHS has a higher threshold.
2 - Set an action plan to hold discussions and negotiations to come to a collaborative decision to improve the funding provisions for IVF in same sex couples.

Questa confusione ha da sempre penalizzato la tutela e il benessere di questi animali protetti e con un ruolo biologico fondamentale per l’integrità dell’ecosistema marino.

Sono numerosi i riscontri, per esempio durante le delicate fasi di traslocazione, schiusa e ispezione dei nidi di tartarughe marine, di personale volontario non in possesso di idonei titoli di studio e adeguate competenze che si permette, bypassando il parere medico veterinario, di valutare lo stato di “BENESSERE” dei neonati e di decidere in modo del tutto arbitrario il destino di esemplari rimasti per troppo tempo sotto la sabbia, incastrati, feriti, completamente disidratati e stressati.

Ancor peggio, succede anche che piccoli di tartaruga marina vengano trattenuti sulle spiagge o trasportati presso laboratori privati, ancora senza alcun intervento di un medico veterinario, lasciando la valutazione sullo stato di salute degli esemplari, se questi siano bisognosi di cure o liberabili, di nuovo a volontari non in possesso di idonei titoli di studio e adeguate competenze e comunque diversi dai Medici Veterinari.

Per evitare la compromissione del benessere animale, noi sottoscriventi ci uniamo all’Associazione M.A.R.E. (Marine Animal Rescue Effort) Calabria nel chiedere al Governo italiano e alle altre istituzioni in indirizzo di fare quanto in loro potere per non recare danno con decisioni azzardate o superficiali – o non decisioni – alle specie protette e non penalizzare i professionisti che si sono formati e si formano costantemente per la tutela di questi splendidi animali, imponendo:

Why then should Black people living in the UK accept anything less in regards to this grubby report and its deeply insulting remarks about slavery?

The Government sponsored Racial Disparity Commission report into racism not only concludes that systemic race inequality does not exist, which both ignores countless reports over many years that the prove the opposite, but also trounces on our lived experience of persistent and often tragic levels of race inequality in many area of our society, including the criminal justice system, employment, health and housing.

If this systemic race inequality denial wasn’t bad enough, particularly after Covid-19 and its devastating impact on Black and Asian communities, the author and signed commissioners feel arrogant and disrespectful enough to tell Black Briton’s that part of the enslavement of our ancestors was good thing because we ‘re-modelled’, ourselves to ‘African/Britain’. Presumably the author means we should be grateful that our culture, including our African names, were erased by our enslavers.

This petition calls upon the Government, political parties, all politicians and others to unequivocally denounce this divisive, deceitful, shabby report (The Commission's report into racial and ethnic disparities in the UK), along with its author Dr Tony Sewell. But it also calls upon the new Head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Baroness Faulkner, to unequivocally apologise for endorsing a report that is both insulting to all Black Asian and Minority Ethnic communities and one that undermines the EHRC in its duty to tackle persistent structural race inequality."

In recent years this elusive and relatively unknown species was feared to be facing extinction due to its apparent low numbers and threats including the spread of the cane toad into its habitat.

In the early 2000's, Dr Gavin Bedford (herpetologist, conservationist & wildlife park manager) and Greg Miles (conservationist & former park manager from Kakadu National Park) devised a plan to establish this species in captivity to ensure its ongoing survival. The plan involved collecting a small number of founder animals from the wild, establishing captive breeding programs and then returning the foundation group back to their original home in the wild. Believing private keepers can contribute in an important way to conserving threatened species, the plan included using private individuals in the captive breeding program as a way of establishing numbers.

In 2011, the conservation plan for this species was approved by the Northern Land Council, Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife and the Traditional Land Owners.

By 2014, after many trips into remote areas of Arnhem Land, the foundation group was established. On January 30th, 2015 the first captive bred Oenpelli Python hatched as part of this program. Oenpelli Pythons have now been successfully bred several times in captivity by this foundation group and offspring have been sold to wildlife parks and private keepers with a portion of the funds raised going back to the traditional land owners.

At the time of writing, it is possible for private individuals in the Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia to participate in this community conservation program through their respective government wildlife departments. This petition is to support individuals from Victoria and New South Wales to also participate in the conservation plan and request approval from the relevant wildlife departments and state governments to do so.

This will ensure the long-term conservation of the Oenpelli Python."

Most of us are aware that the killer of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe 2015, was convicted poacher AND a member of SCI. How then, can a Union, which purports to genuinely asses the possibility of species risk of extinction, via its 'Red Lists', accept an organisation whose sole purpose is to hunt animals, by means of 'sustainable untilization'.

This article confirms that Walter Palmer was a convicted Poacher and was a member of SCI:

http://www.startribune.com/what-we-know-about-minnesota-dentist-walter-palmer/318943371/

'Sustainable Utilization' has very definitely not been a successful 'conservation model', as our wildlife races to extinction across the Globe. Yet this quote taken from The Guardian Newspaper, just after the death of Cecil the Lion, clearly portrays the IUCN's position: 'Some conservationists cautioned against overreaction. Jane Smart, global director of International Union for Conservation of Nature’s biodiversity conservation group, said trophy hunting can be a good conservation tool when handled properly and regulated'. Really Jane? Our Elephants, Lions, Rhino's to name but three, would certainly show this to be untrue?

Safari Club International continues to tell all who will listen that, they love wildlife so much, that the only way to save it is to hunt it.  An independent report by IFAW revealed that Trophy Hunting 'revenue' directed less than 5% back into Conservation.

They also praise themselves for their acceptance into IUCN:

We, the undersigned demand that Safari Club International are immediately removed from the IUCN members list.

A hunting group, which harbours convicted poachers has NO place in Conservation.

I've witnessed my infant nephew battle for his life, suffering from sepsis caused by E. coli, a result of my landlord's negligence.

My story is not unique—this is the reality for many Australians. More than half of renters are living in severe conditions, ranging from mould infestations to uninhabitable homes. Housing security is a fundamental right, yet many renters are afraid to speak up for fear of eviction or rent increases.

This is why I’m calling for a national strategy/body to ensure minimum housing standards for renters in Australia.

Real estate agents and landlords prioritise profit over the well-being of their tenants, neglecting maintenance and repairs. As a result, 51% of renters live in homes needing repair, 68% fear that requesting repairs could lead to a rent increase, and 44% worry it could result in eviction. Additionally, nearly 1 in 10 renters have experienced eviction ""without grounds,"" and a similar number fear losing their homes in the next year.

With international visitor numbers expected to soar and while housing supply remains limited, renters are being pushed into a corner, at the mercy of landlords.

I have experienced fraud, perjury, assault, harassment, and intimidation by my landlord, who uses these tactics to avoid emergency repairs and responsibility. Despite having lawfully protected attributes as a young indigenous bisexual man, I've faced discrimination and eviction attempts in a corrupt judicial system.

The lack of accountability is a systemic issue, with Australian rental laws lagging behind international standards. Nearly a third of renters in the country endure subpar living conditions, often dismissed as a ""lifestyle choice"" or deemed irrelevant by tribunals and courts.

Our nation is suffering, and our children and elderly are paying the price for landlords, property managers, real estate agents, and elected representatives' negligence and lack of compassion.

We demand a national renter protection body to establish minimum housing standards. Together, we can ensure all Australians have access to safe and secure homes."

Reasons to support the cause:

1-The education improves people's lives:With a higher level of education, a person manages to obtain a higher level of income than if they did not have that training.

2- The education is essential in the “learning society”: we need to create a ""learning society"" as a formula to achieve economic growth, development and social progress.

3- Education has always been important for development, but it has acquired greater relevance in the world as well as due to the no less accelerated development of the media and information technologies.

4- Investing in education is profitable: If a society invests in early childhood education, it encourages schooling, reduces crime, improves children's skills and leads them to higher income levels in their future professional lives.

5-It is essential to support poor and low-educated people to get out of the narrow social, ideological and cultural worlds in which they live confined, and to come into contact with challenging and diverse people, ideas and cultural practices.

Possible result of our initiative.

If we can carry out this request, we can achieve inclusive and quality education for all.

Multiple news outlets say the Trump administration may soon announce plans to eliminate both the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) entirely as part of a plan to curb spending. The administration plans to cut $10 trillion, nearly all of our budget’s non-discretionary spending, over the next 10 years.

The NEA and NEH account for less than .002% of our federal spending -- about 46 cents each, for every American, every year.

The NEA has been the life-blood and foundation of the arts community across our nation since 1965. They provide grants for dance, music, drama, literature, outreach education, and so much more.

The NEH offers research funding to museums, libraries, and colleges. Did you enjoy films like Ken Burn’s Civil War documentary series? That was funded by the NEH, along with 16 other Pulitzer prize winning productions.

Together, these two organizations enrich the arts in America -- giving creativity and freedom of speech a voice and continues to nurture humanity at large. These vital organizations must be spared.

Don’t allow these organizations to slip away quietly into the night. Sign this petition right now and tell Congress to save the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities and help us petition for policy that protects this valuable resources from future partisan shifts with a permanent funding mandate."

We are also asking you to sign in protest of the racial discrimination small stance against real estate discrimination, racial discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and","['Judge Amanda Sanchez Villalobos', 'Germelyn Vivar']",Cristina Mooney,"Fence Lake, NM, United States",7352,"Sep 22, 2018",https://assets.change.org/photos/0/oz/qu/WSOzqumslCwpvLz-800x450-noPad.jpg?1633185818,"In July 2017 Daniel and Cristina Mooney purchased 63 acres in a rural and remote subdivision in Fence Lake, New Mexico in search of a quiet and nature-centered atmosphere to take the next steps of our spiritual journey. We are both from California and have been searching for a beautiful quiet area like this since we left our home state in 2013. We came here with the goal of opening up a community garden to provide food in a food desert, and while we were here we held a holistic wellness retreat and opened a rural campground. Soon after we moved onto our remote land we were targeted by a group of 10-15 people who lived within and around the subdivision who were unhappy that we were here. We are younger than most of the landowners, we are a mixed brown/black couple, we purchased more land than most of the owners here and we have dreadlocs.  We started meeting more landowners around us because one of the members of this group was walking onto private property with a hand on her gun, yelling, screaming and cursing when people didn't believe her about the ""dangerous gun-totting Rastas"". Additionally, the neighbors who did know this lady and also knew us started to try to force us to do things we didn't want to. They tried to coerce us to stop people in the roads with guns and question them about owning property in the subdivision. One of the people we spent lots of time with referred to their group as ""The Mujeres Militia"". After trying to force us to do things we didn't want to we stopped talking to almost everyone around the area.

Then in January 2018, we were visited by Cibola County Sheriff's Department as a result of people from this group filing over 100 Crimestoppers reports with lies like ""They are growing hundreds of marijuana plants, making and selling meth, starting a cult and trafficking marijuana from Colorado."" By March 2018 we were both arrested on false charges (which we are still in the process of fighting) and spent a week in jail after being arrested twice and having our pac of dogs impounded. When we got out of jail and made it to our mailbox we saw that the title company, Quest Title Company, and the real estate company, Santa Rita Land and Cattle Co. LLC, were giving us less than 10 days to pay $4,500 in past due payments from the previous 5 months we had lived on the property. We let them know that Quest Title Company in Grants, NM told us for months that our payment transfers were clearing and our account was current but Santa Rita owners did not respond. We also found out that Santa Rita had received several emails from members of this group stating that they want to find a way to make rules to keep people like us out of the subdivision, they stated they would do anything they could to take our land from us and kick us out of the subdivision. Emails from a member of this group to Santa Rita also stated that the group was ""watching them with binoculars"". We came up with the $4,500 as a result of our friends and extended family in Catron and Cibola County and chose to remain on the property out of our deep love for the land.

Unfortunately, the harassment continued. People from this group and Santa Rita have driven down private roads after dark, driven into our driveways, stolen memory cards and batteries from our game cameras as well as game cameras off of our property and gone out of their way to harass and try to intimidate our friends. Cibola County Officers never came out to look at the evidence of the robbery but ""Cab Notes"" were filed and a copy is in our possession as proof of the incident and how we are being treated within the subdivision and county. Associates of Santa Rita have gone to Daniel's job and made complaints about his work when there were not valid complaints to be made and the attempt to harass him at his workplace was witnessed by management. In June 2018 a Cease and Desist Order was filed against Santa Rita and their associates for the harassment, discrimination, retaliation, and conspiracy to take away our land like they're currently doing. On June 25, 2018, we also made payments to a past due amount of $1,900 and spoke with an employee of Quest Title Company who told us ""The account will not go into a delinquent status as long as you are making payments.""

July was rough for us. We were both working at the same restaurant and barely making enough money to pay for the gas. An online job Cristina was working, suddenly stopped without warning. And since the Sheriff of Cibola County posted pictures of our weapons and medication next to our business logos in March, we hadn't made any sales to bring in any income with our business. We kept working with the faith that the money would come when we needed it and then BAM! Cristina was offered a job. The employer failed to properly conduct a background check and on day 3 of this new job, which was going to cover all the past due and future payments on the property, Cristina was fired when the employer learned of the pending accusations that resulted from the false arrests in March. Then the online job came back into play and we were able to catch up on payments once our checks got here around August 3rd. August 6th we got our checks, deposited them and sent an email to Quest Title Company authorizing a $600 payment to the remaining balance of $700. In the same email, we let Quest Title know that we would be caught up to ALL of our payments, past and currently due, come August 18th. On August 7th we received an email from Santa Rita's lawyer stating that they had terminated our contract because we didn't meet the June 24th deadline for the past due amount, regardless of what Quest Title Company told us on June 25th. Our names were removed from the property in July 2018 and were never notified. We called Quest to confirm the past due amount and they told us that the contract had been terminated, we no longer had any rights to the property and in order to stay we would need to start a whole new contract with the seller. Monsoon season hit, Santa Rita wanted us off the property by September 7th. We reached out to New Mexico Legal Aid and they told us they could help but then never replied to any of the documentation we emailed in. We were told by our lawyer and everyone else that there was nothing we could do but there was no way we could move our things off the property in this deep clay mud, we would get stuck in a second. So we contacted the lawyers and they gave us until September 24th to be off of the property.

There is no way to express the deep deep sorrow and upset we're all experiencing over this. We've grown deeply connected to the land and our ancestors through the land which is the entire reason we came to this area in the first place. Our blood, sweat and tears, not to mention every dime we've made and every dollar invested by our loving supporters. Now we're being kicked off of the property when there are other landowners, who look like everyone else in the subdivision, that are 3 months past due on their land payments and are upset that our family is the only family going through this. Other white people notice the injustices happening to us, and they're more upset than we are because we've become accustomed to it. Unfortunately, we entered into a very poorly written contract that states we aren't awarded any equity or investments in the property should we default on the payments.

Luckily, we were taught to dig. The pain Cristina was feeling over growing to love the land so much and having it ripped away from people hating other people who are different, she found our rights. We learned that, by law, we have 20 days to respond to a Complaint entered against us. We met that guideline, but Santa Rita was pushing for us to be off the property by the 24th. Pushing very very hard. Likely because they knew that we had this 20 days to file a response and request for a hearing with the court on our own behalf, regardless if our lawyer was willing to represent us or not. Santa Rita was trying to force us to sign a second document agreeing to allow the Sheriffs to remove us from the property on the 24th, even though that is 3 days short of the 20-day deadline to file a response with the court. The document would have ultimately relinquished all of the rights we had with the court. This means that we have a right to a trial, which we exercised. And we have a right to have a judge review our supporting documents, which we have.

However, what about the 4-5 months they tried to collect in March? We never got any letters during that time telling us that our payments hadn't been made. Then this same poorly written contract states that we are responsible for notices from the date on the letter, regardless of the day we receive a notice. It wasn't until the 5-month delinquent notice was mailed back to Quest Title Company did we know about the delinquency because we never received the letter. Quest Title was holding on to proof that we never got it, the unsigned returned mail from the post office indicating that the mail was undeliverable. And still, they gave us less than 10 days to pay the delinquent balance. What about the other white landowners who are currently 3 months past due on their land payments? Why are WE being harassed over being less than a month's worth of payments late? Why was our payment denied? Because Santa Rita Land and Cattle Company has sided with the ringleader of this hateful group of people in the Mujeres Ranch Subdivision. This woman flips us the middle finger when passing us in the road and has been caught on video yelling at the car while flipping off our car, and this is also the person Santa Rita says they've ""been friends with for many years. We can't see her making up anything like this."" She's followed guests of our friends to their properties and stared them down, disregarded their greetings and spends most of her time fabricating information about our family and what we do on our property.

It's a lot of hate and negativity to take in, and we thank you for reading this far into our story. We realized that all the injustice that's been done to our family cannot be solved in a day, or a week or a year.

Today we ask that you sign this petition to ask Judge Villalobos of Cibola County District Court to rule in our favor. The Mooney's have filed a Motion for Summary Judgement where we listed 20+ pages of indisputable facts of discrimination, retaliation, and blatant disregard for the law and court orders. We asked that the Court award us with the four properties we originally went into contract with Santa Rita for, monetary damages as seen fit by the court and a restraining order for all Santa Rita owners. As a result of this filing, Santa Rita chose to forfeit their right to respond and instead filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order. Another frivolous attempt to slander and defame the Mooney's and smoke screen the court to the fact that Santa Rita has been selling real estate without a business license since 2006 and has admitted they are unable to furnish a business license for Cibola County, Santa Rita sells the same properties under a ghost-organization by the name of Western New Mexico Land Company (which is not registered with the Secretary of State or Cibola County), and that they are associated with several parties that filed criminal reports about us in 2018 that put us in jail. Furthermore, Santa Rita and their representation, Domenici Law Firm PC, deliberately disregarded Judge Villalobos' Mediation Order by not paying the mediation fee, sending the Mooney's a demand letter titled as a rental agreement and filing a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order. All of this after (1) several community members offered to pay for the full cost of the properties just to allow us to stay (2) after we raised close to $6,000 in a few months to come current with the past due payments that were never communicated to us by Quest Title Company, (3) after serving Santa Rita with a Cease and Desist Letter due to stalking, unequal treatment, and denial of documentation of verbal permission to close one of our roads while white landowners in the subdivision were allowed to close off their roads illegally (without the County's permission).

This is all highly illegal, discriminatory, defamatory, racist, and breaks of number Real Estate Licensing Rules and Regulations, State Business Operating laws and federal civil rights laws that Daniel and Cristina Mooney do not deserve. We've endured three year's worth of hatred, slander, libel, racial discrimination, aggravated stalking, harassment and false imprisonment. We poured everything we had into these properties. We paid for a 640 foot well to be installed on the property, we paid for an electrical pole with a 5th wheel outlet, we built rock and adobe fire rings, we installed a 40 foot shipping container, we spent hours and hours of our life for the past year clearing trees, moving rocks and boulders to make the 4 lots accessible and design them for our future plans. We cleared an area for our home, cleared walking paths, installed a dog run, cleared an area for chickens and we were just about to install a septic system that was going to water the wildflowers we planned to plant next season. We installed 2 greenhouses, 1 of which was destroyed during the raid by Cibola County Sheriff's Department and had built a tall shed we recently had to take down in order to leave the property we love.

We are asking Judge Villalobos to hold Santa Rita and their representatives accountable for the deliberate disregard of state laws and orders, award us with all the properties, and any other compensation the court see fit. We are also asking you to sign in protest of the racial discrimination we're experiencing. We appreciate any words to our character from those of you that have known us or followed our journey on social media over the last 8 years. Please share anything you feel the court should take into consideration when making a ruling on our case. We're asking you to please take a small stance against real estate discrimination, racial discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and religious discrimination. All of which are in violation of the Fair Housing Act."
214,Include Climate Education in Schools,"Responding to climate change today encompasses two things:

Reducing our emissions and stabilizing the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (we call this climate change ‘mitigation’);
Adjusting to the actual and expected climate (which is referred to as ‘adaptation’).

So we need to change the way individuals think and act to “change minds, not the climate”, and","['Bhupender Yadav', 'Ministry of Environment', 'Forest and Climate Change', 'Ashwini Kumar Choubey', 'Gopal']",Aniket Gupta,"Delhi, India",15157,"Sep 24, 2020",https://assets.change.org/photos/0/lf/dm/AULFdMQDSRvXSKt-800x450-noPad.jpg?1600979210,"Responding to climate change today encompasses two things:

There is a variety of instruments that are needed to achieve that – political regulations, financial and technological incentives – but this only works if people understand what climate change is and how to act upon it. So we need to change the way individuals think and act to “change minds, not the climate”, and education is crucial to achieving the dramatic transformation that is needed.

Education is an essential element of the global response to climate change. It helps people understand and address the impact of global warming, increases “climate literacy” among young people, encourages changes in their attitudes and behavior and helps them adapt to climate change-related trends. Education and awareness-raising enable informed decision-making, play an essential role in increasing adaptation and mitigation capacities of communities, and empower women and men to adopt sustainable lifestyles.

At a time when students across the world are skipping school to raise awareness around the climate emergency and protest to ensure concrete action for our planet and their future, a major change is needed in the way government forms its environmental & educational policies. It should aim to make education a more central and visible part of the international response to climate change and to ensure it is effectively applied & implemented.

There is already a strong international mandate for climate change education today, which we can appreciate through the successive adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, and the Paris Agreement, which all include education in their provisions. Now this mandate needs to be put into action.

One important aspect of the government should be emphasizing on, is the importance of social-emotional and behavioral learning. In a survey on climate change implementation by UNESCO, they found that most countries still focus on cognitive knowledge – which is important of course, but we need to touch people’s heads, hearts, and hands to help them understand the causes and impact of global warming today. Governments need to further tap into the power of social, emotional, and behavioral learning. We need to harness all aspects of learning need to make that change happen.

Our approach to schools and education also needs to drastically change in order that it essentially seeks to incorporate sustainability into all aspects of a school, and to involve the community, to create a learning environment where students and educators breathe and live sustainability.

Playing in the rain is something children do everywhere – and as the rains get more extreme, they still seem “normal” to a child. It is only later when they encounter information about climate change in a school that they realize the harm they see every day.

A recent survey by educational company Brainly found that 79% of Indian students feel it's important to study climate change and environmental conservation.

India is one of the few countries where environmental education is compulsory in formal education. But 65% of the Indian population remains unaware of climate change as a problem, according to Yale University. Of the remaining 35% - mostly educated people – 80% see it as a serious threat.

Climate and environmental education are paramount to equip the new generation with the knowledge, awareness, and skills needed to tackle climate change and other environmental challenges, and in 2019 leaders at the COP25 climate conference called on all countries to commit to climate education by COP26.

India’s first endeavor to include environmental education in formal education was made under the National Policy on Education in 1986. The National Curriculum Framework, in 2005, further stressed the integration of environmental issues and recommended project-based learning.

In 2016, the UGC introduced a six-month compulsory course on environmental studies for undergraduates from all disciplines.

But the themes introduced in our schools and colleges are far away from the immediate concerns of climate change.

They are mostly centered on information like environmental laws, wildlife protection, Supreme Court decisions, and things like the kinds of grasses grown in India. They don’t talk about greenhouse effects, health concerns from climate change, impacts of a changing climate, and other important topics.

Environmental education in India is strongly influenced by rapid economic development,  which has led to a pile of environmental issues due to natural resource depletion.

The extent of pollution, overpopulation, rapid deforestation and overexploitation of natural resources in the race to become a global economy has also transformed the Indian education system to produce consumers that can contribute to the global economy.

Practical knowledge is very important in climate education. In the syllabus, there should be mention of environmental problems students face in their everyday lives. Then complex global environmental problems should be connected to this.

When students realize how closely linked environmental issues are to their lives and future, they will be motivated to conceive solutions. It will develop a behavioral change in them.

The curriculum should promote experimental learning to make students directly engage in solving the environmental problems in their surroundings. Beyond textbooks, students should be taught about realities on the ground. The educational institution should organize debates and propose solutions to environmental challenges with environmentalists.

Teachers also need training programs to give them confidence and knowledge in facilitating climate change and sustainability education inside and outside the classroom.

For now, our education system is apathetic towards climate education – a bit like it has been to “Moral Science” education.

Teachers should be trained to help young people understand the causes and consequences of climate change, bring about changes in attitudes and behaviors to reduce the severity of future warming, and build resilience to it.

That would lead to climate literacy in India’s Resultantly, it will lead to the climate literacy of India’s nearly 25 crores (250 million) school students. It will boost India’s fight against climate change if even half of these students take climate issues seriously.

Environmental education is the way to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, an essential tool to fight the climate crisis. It can prompt a profound cultural change that contributes to our planet’s sustainability.

As the world is prepared for COP26 in November, it’s time for India to adopt an environmental and climate education policy that works.

I, along with all the Young Climate Activists demand the Education & Government leaders of India include Climate Education in schools.

Let us not forget that Young People have the power to change the world!

With hope & your support,

I live in beautiful Roanoke VA. The best place in the entire world in my opinion. However, Appalachian Power (the only monopoly electric company in the area) has decided they would rather take our hard earned money not just in our area, but in all areas they have service in. They go unchecked and raise rates and make up bills with no remorse. They blame it on everything from inflation to your house not being energy efficient (when your home is energy efficient).

This needs to stop now. I created this petition because I have taken the steps to meet with my state representative and the governor of West Virginia (where Appalachian Power holds a business license)

We the signers of this petition hereby call for the immediate halting of all offshore wind activity currently being progressed (undertaken) along the New Jersey shore. We call on both the Federal Government and the State of New Jersey to ensure a thorough independent, transparent investigation of these 7 (as of this writing) whale deaths. We ask these investigations be carried out by federal agencies with independent, third party scientific oversight.

These massive, unprecedented experimental projects have been fast-tracked without meaningful public input, and with all the impacted cities and towns denied the right to home rule by executive action of the Governor of New Jersey.

The proposed offshore wind farms could result in irreversible ecological damage to the marine environment, including the injury or death of thousands of marine species, and as a result, greatly diminish the quality of life in our coastal communities. These projects are projected to reduce shore residents' property values, curtail tourism, severely affect the fishing, boating, and hospitality industries, greatly increase energy costs to New Jersey ratepayers, and provide no tangible benefits to the people of the State of New Jersey.

In addition, this activity is proceeding before the required Environmental Impact Statements have even been finalized. This goes directly against both Federal and State Government's responsibilities to protect the precious, unique, and delicate ocean environment that is beloved and appreciated by so many millions of people from around the world and contradicts the primary goal of Executive Order 14008 which is to conserve our lands, waters, and biodiversity through clean energy technologies and infrastructure.

We state here that there are many other strategies that can generate energy in a safer and more environmentally favorable way, so that New Jersey's greatest natural resource is not put at risk. Moreover, the people of the state deserve to know the quantified benefits and corresponding cumulative negative impacts of all such projects, and to participate in ANY such decisions of this magnitude going forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Protect Our Coast NJ

La « Stratégie pour la Durabilité dans le domaine des Produits Chimiques » proposée par la Commission européenne est une nouvelle menace car les méthodes pour évaluer les risques pour la santé et l’environnement ne tiennent pas compte de la complexité et de la spécificité des produits naturels et des huiles essentielles.

·         Pour rappel ...

Les huiles essentielles sont obtenues par distillation à la vapeur d’eau d’une matière végétale, ou pour les agrumes, par un procédé mécanique visant à récupérer l’huile essentielle logée dans la peau. Ces méthodes ancestrales permettent d’extraire les molécules aromatiques des plantes, écorces ou fruits, et de les concentrer en un seul et même composé liquide. Elles trouvent ensuite de nombreuses applications dans la vie quotidienne (médecine, cuisine, cosmétique, produits d’entretien...). Et comme l’indique si bien leur nom, elles sont l’essence même du végétal et sa signature olfactive si caractéristique.

·         Aidez-nous à sauver le naturel !

En signant cette pétition, exigeons ensemble de la Commission européenne une approche spécifique adaptée aux produits naturels et aux huiles essentielles, car si nous n’intervenons pas dès maintenant, ce sont des produits de consommation de tous les jours (comme le savon à la lavande), des exploitations agricoles et de nombreux savoir-faire authentiques qui pourraient venir à disparaître. Ainsi, seule la prise en compte de la complexité des matières premières végétales permettra de garantir la sécurité du consommateur, de l’environnement et la poursuite de ces cultures telles que nous les connaissons aujourd’hui.

Ce n’est qu’un petit geste pour vous, mais un grand coup de pouce pour notre filière. Aidez-nous à sauvegarder les richesses du monde agricole et aidons les agriculteurs qui ont fait de leur passion leur métier pour vous offrir chaque année des produits de qualité !

BCCI or ICC should allow at least 1 woman cricketer to be a part of playing eleven in a popular tournament like IPL(Indian premier league) or T20 world cup.

The ceremonies require the maintenance of undisturbed nature in their immediate surroundings. The development would eliminate this and encroach upon the Human and Civil Rights of Indigenous Peoples by disrupting cultural gatherings on Indigenous ancestral lands and threatening the continuity of their religious freedom. The ancestral sites that will be threatened have been sacred to the Oto-Missouria, Ponca, Pawnee, UMÓⁿHOⁿ (Omaha), and many other Indigenous Peoples who have been stewards and inhabitants centuries before this city was called “Lincoln.” Other Indigenous inhabitants of the state now known as “Nebraska” include Dakota, Lakota, Arapaho, Tsististas & Suhtai (Cheyenne), and Kaw Peoples as well as the relocated Ho Chunk (Winnebago), Iowa, and Sac & Fox Peoples.

Only a week prior to April 25th, the City Council held a hearing and dozens of opponents to the project spoke up. As opposition grew during that week (including opposition letters with signatures approaching 200), Lincoln City Council rushed through a decision in favor of the development. Native activist and leader Kevin Abourezk (Rosebud Sioux), described how only two council members even mentioned the sweat/purification lodge’s significance: “That’s a total slap in the face. It’s Native erasure, is what it is. They want to forget about us. They don’t want us here” (Lincoln Journal Star).

On Monday, May 2, 2022, several Native leaders and spiritual advisors, including Kevin Abourezk, Linda Sue White Eyes, Susan Roan Eagle, Renee Sans Souci, and their allies, established the Niskithe Prayer Camp with requests for respect, visibility, and protection for the land, Indigenous ceremonies, and Indigenous Rights. They established this prayer camp in direct opposition to the planned development.

We, the undersigned, call the city leaders of Lincoln, Nebraska (including the Mayor and City Council members, the Catholic Diocese of Lincoln, and Manzitto Construction) to honor, respect, and protect the land, ceremonies, and Religious Rights of local Native peoples as elaborated on niskitheprayercamp.com. We call particular attention to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples which affirms that (emphasis added):

• “Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practice, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites” (Article 12.1).

• “Indigenous peoples have the right to participate in decision-making in matters which would affect their rights” (Article 18).

• “States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples […] in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them (Article 19).

• “Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual relationship with their traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used lands, territories, waters […] and other resources and to uphold their responsibilities to future generations in this regard” (Article 25).

Please join with Native leaders and many others in supporting Indigenous rights and maintaining their sacred purification lodges. Sign and share this petition to support the people and community of Niskithe Prayer Camp and their requests for structural and institutional equities, dignity, visibility, and other Human, Civil, and Religious Rights.

Say no to the Wilderness Crossing development project! Say yes to Indigenous Peoples and their right to exist, thrive, and engage in spiritual and cultural practices on their own terms."

The Iranian people have risen against the tyranny of the ideological dictatorship of the ayatollahs, the regime that for 40 years has shouted “Death to America,” insisted that they want to remove Israel from the world map, launched all kinds of insurgency in Saudi Arabia, and taken Europe hostage.

Now the world needs to support the Iranian people, because they are doing what the world needs to do: they are trying to neutralize the greatest state sponsor of terrorism.

In order to achieve that, we believe the first step should be to grant the people of Iran free and unlimited access to the Internet so that they can send their message out to the world, especially in these historic hours when they have stood up to the oppressive regime across the nation. We sincerely hope that the United States of America will assist Iranian freedom fighters in their fight against tyranny and for democracy.

All of this in addition to the elimination of Art History. There are numerous misrepresentations in this secretly conceived document. Is this a brazen and cynical use of the tragic circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis to attack the arts at Kean? You decide.

There is hope. We are extremely excited and encouraged that Dr. Lamont Repollet, the current Commissioner of Education for the State of NJ, will be arriving on campus on July 1 to start a new era of openness, growth and vision for Kean University. Dr. Repollet has a distinguished career in education and understands the value of the diversity and inclusiveness that is Kean.

Please join us in directing your positive appeals to our President-elect and his colleagues in Trenton, including the Governor's Office.

On behalf of the Music Conservatory: In the resolution, it is falsely claimed that our Kean Music degrees attract 1-4 students per year. For decades, the freshman class has consistently been between 15-25, resulting in a cohesive and effective, yet modest-sized program. Our alumni go on to the finest graduate schools such as the Peabody Conservatory of Music and the Manhattan School of Music, and they win recognition for their teaching---they are some of the shining stars of the NJ Public School system.

False claims were also made about the financial viability of the Conservatory. With over 60 majors (and serving over 600 non-Majors), Music pays for itself in financial and, more importantly, other intangible ways in its contribution to campus and local community culture—all for less than 1% of Kean’s total operating budget. Kean University has contacted incoming freshmen of the Music Conservatory and told them they can not attend Kean University, unless they switch programs!

Unfortunately, the services provided have been halted since the November 23, 2021 with neither a notice before closure nor a possible date of resumption.

This abrupt action has caused many refugees from being deprived of basic identification documents which in the current situation in Ethiopia can mean the risk of being jailed for suspicions of being a rebel. Other refugees have had to delay or completely cancel legal immigration plans as they have no access to documents and/or visas.

This issue is feared to be fueling a surge in illegal migration and human trafficking as many refugees resort to such things when legal corridors aren't available. It needs to be underlined that most of these refugees are women and children. So we are kindly asking the UNHCR to provide a solution for these refugees as soon as possible."

Les cochons sont des êtres sensibles et intelligents, qui ressentent la joie et la douleur. Pourtant au Québec, plusieurs festivals, comme le 'Festival du cochon de Sainte-Perpétue', organisent des 'courses' de cochons graissés où des cochons apeurés sont lancés dans une arène pour être pourchassés sans relâche, attrapés et jetés sans ménagement dans une benne. Les participants, certains au gabarit impressionnant, vont jusqu'à se jeter sur eux de tout leur poids dans leur quête misérable de divertissement et de triomphe. Est-il nécessaire de décrire la peur, l'anxiété, le tourment, les blessures physiques, visibles ou non, et la souffrance aiguë que ressentent les cochons soumis à tel traitement? Peut-on imaginer faire subir aux chiens et autres animaux de compagnie ces traumatismes? N'oublions pas que ces cochons passent leur vie enfermés dans des fermes industrielles.

La violence et la cruauté dont ils sont les victimes au cours desdits festivals ne font qu'ajouter à l'horreur de leur vie et leur causent une détresse supplémentaire inutile.
Malgré la Loi sur le bien-être et la sécurité de l'animal, votée à l'unanimité par l'Assemblée nationale du Québec, le 4 décembre 2015, ces cochons, utilisés comme vil divertissement, se retrouvent dans un 'no man's land' juridique puisqu'ils ne font pas partie de la catégorie d'animaux qu'elle protège.

Pigs are sentient and intelligent creatures who experience the whole range of emotions from joy to pain. Yet in Quebec, pigs are used to entertain crowds at cruel “pig race” festivals, such as the infamous “Pig Festival of Ste-Perpétue”. During those races, pigs are chased around the arena− to the point of exhaustion only to be captured and hurled into a dumpster. In their pursuit of triumph over the defenseless, the pig stalker, often heavyweight men, will throw themselves at the young and terrified animal with all their might. Who can deny that these pigs suffer terror and pain− not to mention the internal and external physical injuries that are unavoidable during those ordeals? Could anyone even imagine subjecting dogs and pets to this type of trauma? And yet, such cruelty is routinely inflicted on pigs that are just as sensitive to suffering. Lest we forget, all these pigs spend their lives on factory farms. Only two times they are allowed to breathe fresh air: When they are used during chases, and when they are transported to their deaths at the slaughterhouse.  The violence and cruelty inflicted on them for the sake of entertainment just adds insult to injury and causes unnecessary additional distress.
Despite the Animal Welfare and Safety Act, adopted unanimously by the National Assembly of Quebec on 4 December 2015, these pigs as used in entertainment, are excluded from the category of ""animal"" and are therefore left in a legal no man’s land. It is time to recognize that as sentient creatures, pigs have their own interests: to be free from harm. It is time to realize that these chases literally trample on the most basic interests of the farmed animals in our care.

But despite the Program’s historic achievements in advancing farmworkers' human rights, one buyer is still standing in the way of progress:  Wendy’s Program and agree to protect the basic human rights of workers in their supply chain.
Not only has","[""Wendy's""]",Coalition of Immokalee Workers,United States,124175,"Aug 15, 2016",https://assets.change.org/photos/9/nw/jm/panwjMpcdGZTIvl-800x450-noPad.jpg?1529337076,"For decades, farmworkers in the U.S. have faced physical and verbal abuse, daily threats to their health and safety, racial discrimination, wage theft and grinding poverty. Farmworkers also experience unconscionably high rates of sexual violence and harassment in the fields. In 2010, the Southern Poverty Law Center found that 80% of farmworker women report that they have experienced sexual harassment on the job.

And in the most extreme cases, farmworkers have faced modern-day slavery, with nearly a dozen forced labor operations uncovered over the past two decades in Florida’s fields alone.

That’s the bad news.  Here’s the good news:

Today, there is a solution.  As farmworkers, we have created the Fair Food Program, a groundbreaking partnership among workers, growers, and major retail brands like McDonald’s, Whole Foods and Burger King that is ending decades of farmworker poverty and powerlessness.  The Fair Food Program has been called “the best workplace-monitoring program” in the U.S. in the New York Times, and “one of the great human rights success stories of our day” in the Washington Post, and has won widespread recognition for its unique effectiveness from a broad spectrum of human rights observers, from the White House to the United Nations.  Just last year the Fair Food Program received a Presidential Medal for its unique success in fighting modern-day slavery and other human rights abuses in corporate supply chains.

But despite the Program’s historic achievements in advancing farmworkers' human rights, one buyer is still standing in the way of progress:  Wendy’s.

We are calling on you to stand with farmworkers in boycotting Wendy’s until they join the Fair Food Program and agree to protect the basic human rights of workers in their supply chain.

Not only has Wendy’s turned its back on the farmworkers who harvest its produce, but it has taken steps that directly undermine the transformation that has been brought about by the Fair Food Program.  Here’s how:

It is unconscionable that Wendy’s refuses to support one of today’s most promising models to end poverty and human rights abuses in low-wage industries across the world.

In five short years since its implementation, the Fair Food Program has prevented modern-day slavery and sexual violence, improved farmworker wages, and guaranteed basic safety protections for workers. Since the Program’s inception, participating buyers have paid well over $20 million into the FFP, helping to alleviate the poverty that our families have faced for decades.

And we aren’t stopping with Florida tomatoes. In the past year, we expanded into Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey, and to two new Florida crops, strawberries and bell peppers.  Thanks to the support of participating buyers, the Fair Food Program has expanded its protections to tens of thousands of new workers, and is poised to grow exponentially in the years ahead.

Today, we need you to tell Wendy’s that if they want your business, they must join the Fair Food Program.

In the 20th of August an astonishing case of mass murders of homeless dogs in 8 huge graves, made by professional heavy equipment, was found 300 meters (about 100ft) from The Municipal dog shelter which operates and is funded by taxpayers money.For every homeless dog in shelter care: the government pays for capturing, feeding and housing for about a month, sterilisation and safe release to the place of habitat. This is a humane program to support the recent Law #498 approved by the President Vladimir Putin personally in which the rights of the animals are fixed. All the dead dogs were marked with fresh ear tags of that Municipal Shelter with numbers and also the veterinarian products and anesthesia for animals also provided by the government and the bio-materials and other veterinary waste materials after sterilisation were found in the graves.The citizens of Volgograd are demanding an independent thorough investigation from the local government and police. But instead the Municipal Shelter and the local Press started the bullying of volunteers saying that it’s them who did that. No further investigation of the graves has been made and it was announced that the graves (evidence) will be destroyed in the nearest future. The Police and the Ecological Prosecutor are keeping silent. The veterinary committee says it’s not a big deal and is not pursuing any investigation of the matter.The volunteers have recorded everything on numerous videos but officials are not interested in investigation either.The funding for “Dead souls' of dogs is provided by the tax money, instead the animals are eliminated, and it’s not clear what happens with their funding budget. The volunteers are sure that this is not only a case of unbearable cruelty but also ecological disaster.Please make as many reposts as possible, sign this Petition! We need your support and justice, Mr President but we don’t know how to get this information to you! Please Help stop killing animals at our tax money expense, we are proud of Animal protection laws adopted in Russia and these laws should be followed by everyone! The crimes against animals should be investigated and punished according to the law.Please help STOP killing dogs at our money! We don’t want to pay for INHUMANITY and CRUELTY!From June volunteers are not aloud into the shelter, the same is with the citizens who are looking for their own dogs.

In the 20th of August an astonishing case of mass murders of homeless dogs in 8 huge graves, made by professional heavy equipment, was found 300 meters (about 100ft) from The Municipal dog shelter which operates and is funded by taxpayers money.For every homeless dog in shelter care: the government pays for capturing, feeding and housing for about a month, sterilisation and safe release to the place of habitat. This is a humane program to support the recent Law #498 approved by the President Vladimir Putin personally in which the rights of the animals are fixed. All the dead dogs were marked with fresh ear tags of that Municipal Shelter with numbers and also the veterinarian products and anesthesia for animals also provided by the government and the bio-materials and other veterinary waste materials after sterilisation were found in the graves.The citizens of Volgograd are demanding an independent thorough investigation from the local government and police. But instead the Municipal Shelter and the local Press started the bullying of volunteers saying that it’s them who did that. No further investigation of the graves has been made and it was announced that the graves (evidence) will be destroyed in the nearest future. The Police and the Ecological Prosecutor are keeping silent. The veterinary committee says it’s not a big deal and is not pursuing any investigation of the matter.The volunteers have recorded everything on numerous videos but officials are not interested in investigation either.The funding for “Dead souls' of dogs is provided by the tax money, instead the animals are eliminated, and it’s not clear what happens with their funding budget.

Recovery Community organizations all across Georgia bridge the gap between medical institutions, law enforcement, human service agencies and judicial systems. They provide a cost effective solution to hold space for individuals entering or reentering recovery.

As a woman in long term recovery ( 14 years) I realize how vital these peer driven services are. Our center serves Women leaving the sex trade, survivors of trafficking and individuals overcoming addiction. 23 years ago when I escaped the sex trade there was no such thing as peer lead organizations or a recovery movement. Where will we be if we turn back the hands of time 20 years...in the midst of a Pandemic?? Our partners that have founded other Recovery Centers are also people in long term, successful recovery with equally powerful stories of redemption.

If the proposed state budget cuts pass, the state will pay for it ten fold on the back end of COVID-19 and there will certainly be casualties along the way.

Vote “No” to the proposed 4 million dollar shut down of Addiction Recovery Centers and the other vital, life saving services connected to peer lead services in the mental health and substance abuse space."

Mais ce qui a déclenché mon envie de me battre contre l'excision c'est un voyage en 2009 à Conakry dans ma famille. Là, l'une de mes cousine pleurait. Je lui ai demandé pourquoi. Elle m'a dit que ses amies ne voulaient pas jouer avec elle parce qu’elle n'avait pas été excisée. J'ai pensé qu'il fallait réellement stopper cette pratique, et pour cela, changer les mentalités. Je suis issue d'une culture où on excise les petites filles donc très vite j'ai posé des questions, beaucoup de questions. On ne me répondait pas vraiment, on me disait juste que c'était comme ça ! J'ai parlé avec des membres de ma famille, de ma communauté, d'autres communautés qui pratiquaient aussi l'excision et l'une des raisons les plus évoquée est qu'on excise les petites filles pour qu'elles soient sages et qu'elles ne s'approchent pas des garçons. En faisant mes recherches, j'ai trouvé des centaines de raisons « justifiant » l'excision. Mais je ne les approuve pas et j'ai toujours su qu'un jour je lutterai contre cette pratique.  Les conséquences de l'excision sont nombreuses et peuvent être très graves pour les victimes. Dans les pires des cas, la victime meurt ! Et c'est souvent arrivé. Les femmes excisées peuvent avoir des accouchements très compliqués, certaines sont en proie à des infections tout au long de leur vie. Aujourd'hui, que ce soit à l'école, dans les familles ou dans les médias, personne ne parle de l'excision. Et pourtant en France plus de 50 000 femmes sont excisées. Combien seront-elles demain ?  Pour éviter que ce chiffre n'augmente, il est temps d'en parler et briser ce tabou. Il est temps de sensibiliser toutes les jeunes filles aux mutilations génitales féminines. C'est pourquoi je lance cette pétition pour ouvrir le débat sur le sujet : je demande à la ministre de l'Education d'inclure le sujet de l'excision dans le plan national de sensibilisation aux violences faites aux femmes qui est dispensé dans les établissements scolaires.  Il est vrai que dans certaines écoles, de certaines villes de France (principalement dans les banlieues d'Ile-de-France), les élèves sont sensibilisés à la pratique des mutilations génitales féminines. Cependant, pour briser le tabou, il est nécessaire de sensibiliser les centaines, les milliers de jeunes filles partout en France pour que les victimes ne se sentent plus seules et que celles qui sont à risque comprennent que ce n'est pas normal. Personne ne doit être oublié. J'appelle l'ensemble des signataires à partager le plus largement possible ma pétition, et à se mobiliser pour que cette violence faites aux femmes cesse définitivement en France."

And what was his so-called offense? Tremaine looked at the police in a way they didn't like. 
On Memorial Day i took my children and their friends to the beach to play with their new puppy. Tremaine was horsing around with a friend when the police rode up on ATVs. My son was holding a newborn puppy in one hand and a bottle in the other. When the police asked Tremaine where I was, he turned in my direction to lead them to me.

Worst of all, police charged Tremaine with felony resisting arrest by violence when he wasn't doing anything in the first place! My son is no felon -- he is a boy with a puppy who was brutalized by police. He doesn't deserve this.

A l’heure où, internationalement, l’on s’émeut du sort de Notre-Dame de Paris, le Département de l’Oise renonce au Centre culturel de rencontre qui avait pour vocation la transmission, la compréhension et le rayonnement de ce lieu d’exception.

Ainsi, les habitants et les visiteurs se trouvent dépossédés d’un lieu culturel qui a inscrit son action au service de la préservation du patrimoine historique et naturel, de l’éducation artistique, culturelle et environnementale, de la connaissance de la nature et de sa portée écologique, artistique, littéraire, philosophique et sociale.

Il est question de céder, voire de privatiser, le site à un exploitant commercial et de renoncer à l’ambition culturelle indissociable de ce jardin paysager – ambition notamment attachée à la pensée rousseauiste.

Nous demandons que le Parc Rousseau demeure un bien commun ouvert au plus grand nombre et que sa vocation reste fidèle aux idéaux qui nous ont été transmis par les générations antérieures, pour nous et les générations à venir, en faveur de la sensibilité, de la citoyenneté et de l’épanouissement par la culture.

Nous demandons que le sort de ce site patrimonial soit l’objet d’une réelle concertation, car il est aussi un lieu historique attaché aux fondements de notre démocratie qu’il est urgent de préserver.

-       Pour que le Parc soit protégé et restauré comme monument historique

-       Pour que le Parc reste un lieu préservé pour la biodiversité et les espèces fragiles de la faune et de la flore locales

-       Pour qu’un programme culturel de qualité, varié et accessible à tous continue d’y être proposé

The proposed housing project is in the wrong location to provide for the needs of the tenants. There is inadequate transit, no substantial medical or mental health facilities, no adult education resources, no job training resources and last but not least, no reasonable entertainment sources.

We believe that the minimal proposed on-site staffing level is dangerous for the staff, the residents, and the general public.  The proposed location is in the direct vicinity of several centre's for vulnerable members of the public: numerous child day cares, elementary schools, a high school, the Czorny Alzheimer's care centre, as well as the forthcoming PICS 5-storey, 140-bed senior's home.

To make things even more difficult for the supportive housing residents, now that the movie theatre is gone the only places open after the sun goes down are a few take-out restaurants, 4 bars and a 24-hour casino.

The City of Surrey recently expended a huge amount of time and money working on a Cloverdale Town Centre Plan to revitalize Cloverdale's historic downtown. No part of the Plan is conducive to a 60-unit supportive housing building being built at its very core.

The proposed location is ill-conceived and poorly thought out. It is not a location that offers any hope of future success for the disadvantaged people who will be forced to move there.

Once again, we the undersigned residents of Cloverdale are against Application # 7918-0258-00 going forward in Cloverdale.

PRAY!

To those of you who pray, we hereby ask you to pray to God for wisdom and understanding; for help in reacting and asking others to react properly to the coronavirus and the housing crisis; for a good and accurate understanding of the needs of those who consume housing and those who provide housing, as well as those who provide services through their small businesses.  As our President has requested, pray, pray and pray!

Petition

As a result and only because of recent laws and orders that have been put into effect, the undersigned do hereby petition you to do all you can to immediately support a twelve-month mortgage, utilities and tax moratorium. We urgently implore you to pay the rent for all tenants that the government classifies being eligible to stay and not pay!

Wrong Solutions

Please consider that the government’s current solutions (laws and orders) to this virus may be worse than the problem.  Have we transformed a virus crisis into a social and economic crisis, with consequences more severe than the virus itself?  Could our reaction to this virus cause a severe recession or even a depression? We do know that suspending evictions will create a more severe housing crisis. When people lose their income from their business and/or their job, they can, and many will, also lose their homes, cars, marriages, and their health.  They not only cannot pay the rent, they can’t put food on the table for their kids. Neither can housing be provided for very long without rental income. “Society and friends” will not take care of them or us – i.e. witness the homeless.

Think About This

Would you pass a new law that would allow our needy citizens to go into a grocery store, fill up their carts, check out, and then walk out without paying?  Oh, don’t forget they will be required to pay the full amount for that grocery bill when they go back to work.  A six-month repayment plan will be worked out. Sure!

Let’s Not Be Gullible

Anyone who thinks these currently needy citizens will pay for those groceries or past due rent at a later date was born yesterday.  They will now just move on and buy their food from a different grocery store!  You can just hear them saying, “That food was free.  I had no savings or extra money then and I do not have it now. How do they expect me to pay for that free food and rent either now OR later?”

Why Have You Done This to Us?

This is exactly what you have allowed to happen to the rental housing industry that was already in a “crisis”.  Laws have been passed that allow renters to walk into a privately-owned building, live in and enjoy the apartment, and ring up a huge bill for back rent that they will never be able to pay.  Even if they were allowed to spread out the payments over a ten-year period, our experience has proven that they will just choose not to pay the housing provider.  That is a proven fact!  Experienced housing providers know this to be true.  It seems that inexperienced politicians do not have this knowledge or do not care.  We ask you to care.  Let government pay their rent.  Better yet, allow us to take care of our renters without your interference in our business.  We have done a pretty good job in the past without your laws that continue to drive up the cost of housing!

We do thank you for exempting property management from the stay-at-home rules and recognizing housing providers as essential.  This will help solve the housing crisis.

Change the Eviction Laws?

The eviction laws were already badly flawed and have now been changed to give an excuse to even rich tenants not to pay their legally due rent.  Many renters have money in the bank or can borrow from family or friends.  Housing providers are not in the lending business! The government should loan the rent money to tenants, not the housing providers who are already doing their part. All taxpayers normally pay for this type of welfare.

Individual Financial Burden

Please consider that this financial burden should not be passed on to only individual housing providers who, for many years, have already solved a large portion of the housing crisis.  Many housing providers also live from paycheck to paycheck, or from monthly rental income.  How about a moratorium on our property taxes?  Bills have to paid; like the mortgage, utilities, insurance, maintenance, manager, gardener, trash, painter, plumber, electrician, and on and on.  Who do you think will pay these people when the rent is not paid?  In addition, many owners are still paying for the soft story earthquake retrofits. This can amount from $50,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars that are now being paid (in addition to all the other bills!) Have mercy!  Consider a twelve-month delay in requiring this work to be completed.

Please Take Immediate Action

We are in the business of providing housing and keeping our renters happy.  We know we have to share the burden of this virus.  Help us out!  Pass a moratorium so that we can defer our mortgage payments, property taxes and utility bills and then we can defer the rent for the renters who need our help.  We’re asking that Government share the burden and allow housing providers to also defer our expenses.

Please Consider: Reinstituting laws that require rental payments to be paid when owed to any individual housing provider.  Have the government loan housing consumers the money or pay their rent for them instead of putting the whole burden on individual housing providers.  OR, pass a moratorium on expenses that owners are required to pay so we can pass on the benefits to our housing consumers. Better yet, allow our old American Economic System of Free Enterprise to work and together we can solve this problem, along with getting rid of all the panic and fear that the news media has generated.

Prayer Pledge

Those of us who pray hereby pledge to you to pray for our tenants, political leaders, those affected by the virus, and other disease(s) that are taking even more lives, healthcare workers and the homeless.

Leadership Needed

With your leadership, commitment to the housing industry and immediate actions of fairness, we look forward to serving our customers and being a huge part of the solution for our housing crisis.

Thank you for your consideration.

240,Electric Crematoriums: Using Clean Energy,"crematoriums with agro-waste, cowdung cakes, CNG, electric and solar energy used instead of wood.","['civic bodies', 'Pmo', 'Mayor']",RARE India,"New Delhi, India",756,3 May 2021,https://assets.change.org/photos/5/jv/jy/bWJVjYcxGBSjRXH-800x450-noPad.jpg?1620015747,"In the mayhem of the Pandemic, in all the death and devastation, is it right to lose sight of the environmental toll of cremating our loved ones and what it means for those they leave behind?

“Authorities in Delhi are being asked to cut down trees in the city for kindling.”

Reports such as this are to be expected as more and more trees are needed to feed the rising death rate due to the pandemic.

Discounting the millions of tons of carbon emissions per year due to the ritual Hindu tradition of cremating the dead on open-air pyres usually close to a river or other water sources, this age old ritual requires cutting down of millions of trees, a practise in the wake of a rising population contributes to substantial air and river pollution.

Every traditional Hindu pyre requires between 300-400 kgs of wood per individual cremation and burns for 4-6 hours; this on an average is one tree per individual depending upon the quality and age of the tree. Given an estimate of close to 1,000,000 deaths per annum, 50-60 million trees are burned during cremations in India, which results in about eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions. Add to this felling also means loss of oxygen and groundwater recharge capacity.

A study by IIT Kanpur on 53 cremation sites based on a conservative amount of 216 Kg of wood per cremation, concluded that 2129 Kg of carbon monoxide, 33 kg of sulphur dioxide, 346 kg of PM10 and 312 kg of PM2.5 are released from cremation sites into the atmosphere every day in the city of Delhi alone.

Delhi has only two crematoriums with Electric and CNG cremation facilities, despite which less than 5% of people opt for the greener options. A renowned sociologist commented on the dismal percentage who opt for greener choices saying that “we follow what we have seen being followed for generations”. Our forefathers lived in a less crowded, cleaner and greener world, we no longer have that privilege. Time to change to more conscious options that benefit us and the future generations.

Nurses and HCAs are subjected to violence within the work place which have resulted in permanent and debilitating injuries and loss of livelihood. Some healthcare professionals have suffered permanent brain damage which prevents them from working, or which means they can only work in certain low-risk areas. Assaults have included boiling water being tipped over nurses, stabbings, strangulation, being knocked unconscious, bones being broken, nails torn out, sexual assault, and having flesh torn from the bone by bites and kicks. Nurses and HCAs are routinely punched, kicked, bitten and spat on. Sometimes the bodily fluids contain infections such as HIV, Hep C, and Hep B.

We acknowledge that it may not be possible to eradicate violence towards healthcare workers completely because it will never be possible to control and dictate the behaviour of patients and the public completely.

However, we demand that the government, DHBs and private hospitals take all steps within their power to protect the health care workers.

We want acknowledgement that restraint minimisation and assault minimisation are goals of equal value. Restraints happen almost entirely after patients have attacked staff or other patients, NOT before.

There is a private members bill being put before parliament to protect and deter people from attacking, paramedics, frist responders and prison guards. We demand nurse and health care workers to be added to this list.

We demand law changes now before someone dies as a result of an assault in the work place. Protecting patients and ensuring that employers are held accountable for failure to provide a safe environment, failure to staff adequately, lack security to assist, damaged or unsecure facilities.

We demand a review of the Mental Health Act to distinguish between the emotionally dysregulated, the (temporarily?) mentally disordered (drug induced psychosis) and the mentally unwell (ongoing mental health/psychiatric diagnosis). If someone drinks, get into a car, and kills someone, they are held accountable for their actions. If someone uses illicit drugs that increase the likelihood of violence and drug-induced psychosis, and then hurts someone, shouldn’t they be accountable for their actions?

We demand an inquiry into the national standard for protocols regarding seclusion, restraint management, and medication for patients who are psychotic and/or under the influence of drugs.

We demand immediate action taken when the work environment is unsafe and we depand employers to be investigated and held accountable for there negligence for not providing a safe environment for there employees. We demand security guards to be present in all at-risk areas immediately. We demand identified unsafe areas to be shut down immediately until repairs have been completed. We demand that employers be investigated and face heavy fines if it does not happen.

Had numerous operations to remove but nothing worked apart from pregnancy and breastfeeding. The pain was so bad at every period. Then the bleeding got really bad and I hardly had any break which in turn made me anaemic and very run down. I was ill every other week due to low immunity. I was very lucky to have had three children as most who have endo cannot conceive. In 2012 I had a resection of the lining of the womb, endometrial ablation and hernia repair to my belly button. At this stage they had to sterilise me due to not having any lining in my womb from the ablation. 3 months later the symptoms started again so I asked for a hysterectomy. The gynea was very against this due to my age,28! I was given zoladex injections which are used in breast cancer patients and also patients to treat menorrhagia (heavy periods) this stopped my periods and put me into menopause for 9 months until they couldn't offer me anymore, as it's unsafe after 9 treatments. The symptoms of menopause were horrendous. Night sweats, migraines, depression, mood swings, crying and just not my usual self. My hrt helped but not enough. Even so I still went through with a hysterectomy aged 29 in November 2013. 6 weeks later I was rushed back with a perforated bowel and hospitalised. It's safe to say the start of 2014 was just awful. I was tired and sick of feeling like crap. Few years on I'm now able to do things I couldn't before such as exercise and simple things like walking my kids to school without horrendous pain. I'm scared that In time I will feel like I did 11 year ago and that's not what I want. People do not realise how endo affects your whole life from holding down a job, looking after your kids and yourself.

《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》(下稱《公約》)訂明各締約國均有責任採取一切適當措施，以保障人類基本的政治和公民權利。《公約》於1976年生效後，亦擴展至適用於香港。而《中英聯合聲明》和《基本法》均訂明，《公約》適用於香港的規定繼續有效。故此，香港政府有責任定期向聯合國人權事務委員會提交報告，交代香港的人權狀況。

港府本應在2018年3月30日提交第四份報告。可惜，至今港府都沒有按聯合國的要求提交，以致聯合國人權事務委員會無法安排召開會議，聆訊和審議香港報告，監察香港如何落實上述公約保障的公民和政治權利。我們強烈質疑和抗議香港政府不按規定準時提交報告，以此迴避聯合國對香港人權狀況的監察。

由於政府就草擬報告的公眾諮詢早在21個月前結束，我們相信政府絕對有能力在這21個月內按規定擬好文件。因此，我們嚴正呼籲香港政府在2019年9月28日前向聯合國提交第四份報告，交代近年香港的人權狀況。這些狀況，應該包括示威、集會、遊行和政治參與權利受到打壓；民選議員被取消議員資格、候選人被剝奪參選資格；新聞及言論自由受壓制；當局攝錄監控市民侵犯個人私隱；警務人員施行酷刑、暴力、濫權和侵犯婦女老弱，其中包括性侵犯；執法因政見不同而有嚴重不公；警方更縱容惡勢力無差別毆打市民；被捕人士在保障人身安全、獲得適當醫療和法律諮詢等各方面的權利備受侵犯，並受到政治檢控等等。

如果政府在此日期前無法向聯合國提交報告，我們將會強烈呼籲聯合國人權事務委員會對香港啟動無報告下聆訊審議的程序，迫使港府在香港事態進一步惡化成人道災難之前，盡早正視一切倒退中的人權問題，尋求解決之道，煞止香港目前全面的人權倒退，有效保障香港的法治和其他公民和政治權利，回復以往基於普世價值的和平，光復香港。

Hong Kong Government yet to submit its human rights report submission We urge the United Nations look into the decline of human rights in the city

Signatories to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights have the responsibility to take all measures to ensure the protection of basic civil and political rights. After the covenant came into effect in 1976 it was extended to Hong Kong. The Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law state the covenant is applicable to Hong Kong and continues to take effect. As a result, the HKSAR government has the responsibility to submit reports to the United Nations Human Rights Committee on the condition of human rights in Hong Kong.

The Hong Kong government was supposed to submit the 4th report on March 30th 2018. However, up till now the Hong Kong government has not adhered to the demands of the United Nations and this has led to the Human Rights Committee members being unable to proceed with a meeting to discuss and evaluate the Hong Kong report and monitor whether Hong Kong’s civil and political rights are being protected. Civil Human Rights Front strongly objects to the late submission of the Hong Kong report and condemns the government for avoiding the United Nations’ monitoring of the human rights conditions in Hong Kong.

The public consultation on the report was completed over 21 months ago, and we strongly believe the government should have had enough time to complete its 4th report and update the committee on the latest human rights condition in Hong Kong before 28th September. The report should include details about the demonstrations, assemblies, marches, the suppression of rights, elected legislators being ousted, right to participate by electoral candidates stripped, the press freedom and freedom of expression being suppressed, citizens being under surveillance and having their privacy encroached upon, the police officers torturing suspects and violently or sexually assaulting women and the elderly, the execution of the law being unfair, the police allowing triads to use violence against its citizens, the arrested citizens being fearful of their personal safety, the right to medical care and legal advice being stripped and being subject to political prosecution.

If the government continues to delay its submission of the report, then the Civil Human Rights Front strongly recommends the United Nations Human Rights Committee conduct a hearing without the report being submitted, and force the Hong Kong government to face up to the reality that the human rights situation in Hong Kong has been in decline and is on the verge of a humanitarian crisis. The conditions should be faced head on to ensure that Hong Kong’s rule of law and the civil and political rights would continue to be enjoyed by everyone.

However, GTA Online doesn't have this option, and it could really benefit the game. A lot of trans people such as myself like to play online games as characters of their gender to relieve dysphoria, which they may not have realized that they had back when they started playing the game. I would love to do this to my character, but it isn't an option. Recently, there was a bug to allow gender changes via the appearance change menu that was patched with the recent casino update. While I was very desperate, I didn't use the bug because I don't agree with exploitation in online games. Online sandbox games (such as GTA Online) are amazing ways to cope with dysphoria, but playing as a character that's the wrong gender without an option to change it can trigger dysphoria in many trans people and make them not want to play the game anymore. These games are like a second life: a temporary escape from our current day to day struggles. Playing as a character that is the right gender would allow many trans people to have a temporarily escape from their struggles with dysphoria.

A possible issue with this would be outfits. Since males and females can't wear the same outfits in GTA Online, this could cause an issue if the player changes their gender. An easy workaround to this is to include a warning that they will lose their outfits and will not be able to refund them.

A solution that is possible right now in-game is to make a new character of one's preferred gender. However, there is no way to transfer the old character's progress over to a new character. For this reason, a gender change should be an option to players. Many people would love nothing more than to keep their hard earned current progress while customizing a character character of their gender, and I am sure many other people (trans or not) feel exactly the same way."

However, the Great Lakes Basin is full of toxins and pollutants that contaminate the water & make it unhealthy and dangerous to consume.

It is estimated that more than 90 billion litres of the waste that is dumped into the Great Lakes each year is untreated sewage. That is the equivalent of dumping more than 100 Olympic swimming pools of raw sewage into the Great Lakes each day!

This basin drains into the Great Lakes water supply, which is designated for the Indigenous peoples’ reserves located on the coast.

Although Canada prides itself as a highly developed, first-world nation, the lack of Federal government action towards this water crisis clearly exhibits the environmental discrimination and injustice towards Indigenous peoples in Canada.

Recently affecting the Chippewas of Georgina Island is the Upper York Sewage Solutions Project, which has been in limbo for over a year now; UYSSP would contribute to the disposal of ""more than 40 million litres of treated wastewater per day into the Lake Simcoe Watershed"". From the most recent updates, the government and decision makers have failed to include the community in any aspects of the project proposal, as well as ignoring critical concerns for health and the environment  - threatening the Lake Simcoe watershed, drinking water quality, along with the rights and livelihood of the Chippewas of Georgina Island residing in the area.

It is a fundamental human right to have clean, safe drinking water, and it is unacceptable that the Canadian government [namely Trudeau’s party in power, most recently] has failed to provide this to Indigenous communities for decades, whilst failing to live up to treaty agreements and personal promises made by the state and PM Trudeau.

Employees at the Rating Unit were allegedly issuing fake receipts, undercutting fees, and collecting bribes and inducements. Between 2020 to 2022, the alleged fraudsters were stealing D4 million per week through these corrupt practices.

When news of the corruption was leaked to the media, the GPA management hastily constituted an internal investigative panel to look into the matter in response to public outrage and concern.

Shortly after, the GPA admitted, through a media statement, that their own investigations revealed an elaborate scheme of theft involving several staffers. It stated that demurrage charges were understated and receipts were issued outside the accounting system, causing significant revenue losses.

Sadly, it would turn out that the management has no real desire to recover the missing millions. The report and recommendations by the panel were submitted to Managing Director Ousman Jobarteh on the 16th March, 2022. But the GPA management refused to release the findings in their entirety and the names of the investigative panel members.

The management of the Gambia Ports Authority is withholding the full investigation report into the missing millions from the public claiming it is not for ""public consumption"".

Gambia, Is that not fishy and laughable given that the millions are public funds/tax payers money?

By signing this petition, you are adding your voice to the grassroots fight demanding the following:

1. That the GPA management to release the full investigation report to the public.

2. That all those found wanting or responsible for defrauding public funds be held accountable.

3. An end to official corruption by people entrusted with public funds.

247,Tell Joe Biden to Stop the Uinta Basin Railway!,"irresponsible and incredibly damaging to the people depending on the Colorado River for clean water less than a decade left to switch to renewable energy before it is too late. Our dependence on campaign was his support of renewable energy and conservation. Now, it has become abundantly clear that",['Joe Biden'],Cleo Scholz,"New Jersey, United States",73347,7 May 2022,https://assets.change.org/photos/6/je/lm/iejELmNsukLAVGy-800x450-noPad.jpg?1651952904,"The Uinta Basin and surrounding areas were once named ""one of the stupendous features of this country"" by explorer John Wesley Powell. Now, it has become a lifeless wasteland, the monotony punctured only by oil wells and thick smog choking the horizon. The Uinta Basin is home to rich oil deposits, and oil companies have been slowly but surely extracting it for decades. However, their efforts have been slowed because it is difficult to transport the oil to places where it can be used. This may not be true for much longer.

Utah representatives are proposing an 88-mile railway that would allow oil companies in the Uinta Basin to quadruple their exports. And President Biden is not making any move to strike it down. This railway would spell disaster for the precious and pristine land of Utah. The railway would pollute over 400 precious streams, many leading to the Colorado River, which provides drinking water to 40 million people. At a time when much of the West is in the grips of drought, we can not afford to lose any other water source. Going through with this railway plan would be irresponsible and incredibly damaging to the people depending on the Colorado River for clean water. Construction will pass directly through vital big-game migration routes and disrupt the breeding grounds of the endangered greater sage grouse. The Biden Administration also approved the passing of the railway through Ashley National Forest, land which is supposed to be protected by the government.

The damages of this railway go beyond the United States. Science has repeatedly told us that we have less than a decade left to switch to renewable energy before it is too late. Our dependence on fossil fuels is killing us, and we need to act now if we want to have any chance of survival. Joe Biden has promised again and again to protect our planet. Since the beginning, a cornerstone of his campaign was his support of renewable energy and conservation. Now, it has become abundantly clear that those words were nothing but empty promises. Joe Biden has become nothing more than another puppet politician, controlled by the oil companies he vowed to oppose. United States oil and gas production has spiked under the Biden administration. At a press conference, he flouted the fact that he has already approved over 9,000 oil drilling permits on federal land, as if caving to corporate interest is something to be proud of. The increase in oil production caused by the railway could release as much as 53 million pounds of carbon dioxide into the air annually. Allowing any more land to be used for fossil fuels is a step backwards.

It is not too late to stop the Uinta Basin Railway. This is Biden's chance to show us who's side he is on; the millions of people that he is supposed to serve, or the the few mega-rich companies that he seeks to please. This is a fight for our survival. Our warming planet has shown us what is in store if we continue to treat the world like a dumping ground. If we make our voices heard, we can remind Biden of the promises he made to us during his campaign. Please share this petition as much as you can, participate in protests, and be a role model for a climate-friendly future.

But the first step to conservation is understanding the extent of,['Department of Environment and Natural Resources'],Elaine Navarra,Philippines,254,"Oct 12, 2019",https://assets.change.org/photos/7/bc/wf/ShBCWFnILPaNhWt-800x450-noPad.jpg?1570843915,"Importance of the endangered species

Healthy ecosystems depend on plant and animal species as their foundations. When a species becomes endangered, it is a sign that the ecosystem is slowly falling apart. Each species that is lost triggers the loss of other species within its ecosystem. Agriculture also plays an important role in the protection of species, farmers are often seen as the original conservationists. Many farmers set aside portions of their land as wildlife habitat and also work in partnership with groups such as Trout Unlimited to restore river and stream habitats for endangered and threatened fish and reptiles.

According to The World Atlas, “megadiversity” refers to countries that harbor a “high total number of species including a significant percentage of endemic species.” And for a country to be classified as “megadiverse”, it must have at least 5,000 species of endemic plants and border a marine ecosystem. “On a per unit area basis, the Philippines probably harbors more diversity of life than any other country on the planet,” the DENR-BMB web site said.

The Philippines is considered to be one of the 17 megadiverse countries in the world. The country’s forest ecosystem hosts a diverse array of plant and animal species. As a matter of fact, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) reported that the Philippines is home to more than 52,177 described species, which are only indigenous to the region. Although the Philippines has a “high degree of land and animal endemism,” it is also tagged as a biodiversity hotspot as the number of endangered and threatened species continues to grow due to habitat loss and inhumane animal activities.

In fact, a number of resident species — which are cultivated or hunted as food — may be heading to extinction, like the critically endangered tamaraw and the Visayan warty pig. Partly due to human consumption, sea turtles (like the green and loggerhead turtle) remain endangered.

There are many ways to conserve and protect these species. But the first step to conservation is understanding the extent of these species’ decline, in order to arrive at solutions with more impact.

Ways to prevent animal extinction in the Philippines

Educate your family about endangered species in your area.

Stop using hazardous pollutants that affect wildlife at many levels.

Try to rebuild their natural habitat or avoid destroying it

Stop hunting especially those critically endangered species

Fund the rehabilitation of their habitat

A violence caused by the permanent concentration of political power in the hands of small economically privileged sectors, who have used the laws for their own benefit, condemning most of the population to the most dishonorable poverty. The social inequality caused by corrupt political practices, has been the main fuel of the war that has produced thousands of deaths over the years.

One of the most violent periods experienced in our recent history, occurred between 1998 and 2010, a period corresponding to the presidential terms of Andrés Pastrana Arango and Álvaro Uribe Vélez, currently unwavering opponents of a negotiated end to the Colombian conflict.

According to Colombian government statistics, during this period there were 5,827,898 direct victims of war, affected by death or situations of displacement, kidnappings and hunger. This macabre number of victims only took a downward turn during the presidential period 2010 - 2018, when the then President Juan Manuel Santos, today Nobel Peace Prize winner, as head of State signed the Havana Peace Agreement, with the guerrilla group known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC—EP), with the support of the international community.

Through this Peace Agreement, the Colombian State entered into binding fundamental commitments, in order to achieve structural social changes to properly fight inequality and lead to a truly peaceful environment.Unfortunately for the great majority of the citizens, since last year, the political forces who maintained their power in Colombia for year by promoting war and fear, succeeded in again taking the presidency. Since then, under the presidency of Iván Duque Márquez, there have been many attacks against the long-hoped-for peace. For instance, during the first eight months of his presidency, a total of 172 social leaders and human rights activists were murdered in Colombia, according to a report by the Institute for Development and Peace Studies (Indepaz).

Likewise, with the objective of impeding the Peacemaking process in Colombia, the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) is under attack by the President himself, his allies in Congress, and the Attorney General's Office (politically co-opted by them), with the support and the improper intervention in Colombian internal affairs by the U.S. President Donald Trump. TheSpecial Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) is an instrumental judicial body at the heart of the Peace Accords (November 2016), with mandatory jurisdiction to investigate the acts of violence during the armed conflict and directed to seek Justice, Truth and Reparation for its victims.

Throughout the grievous recent events, the Colombian Government and its political allies have shown that their personal interests take preference over the welfare of an entire nation.For this reason, we the Colombians find ourselves with the urgent need to do everything possible to prevent the imposition of a political agenda that perpetuates war and impedes the exercise of democracy.

For the above reasons, we ask for the support of the International Community and the leaders of the world that have been our allies in the achievement of Peace in Colombia, for the following purposes:

That PEACE does not cost us life or freedom.

El gobierno de Colombia: su doble discurso y su traición a los acuerdos de paz

Las ciudadanías libres de Colombia, unidas por voluntad propia, anhelantes de construir un futuro mejor para las generaciones venideras, manifestamos a la opinión pública internacional que:

Ningún colombiano ha vivido en paz en nuestro país. Todos somos o hemos sido víctimas de la violencia. Una violencia causada por la concentración permanente del poder político en manos de reducidos sectores económicamente privilegiados, que han usado las leyes en beneficio propio, condenando a la mayoría de la poblacion a la más deshonrosa pobreza. La inequidad social causada por las malas prácticas políticas, ha sido el principal alimento de la guerra que, a su vez, ha producido miles de muertos a lo largo de los años.

Uno de las etapas más violentas vividas en nuestra historia reciente, transcurrió entre los años 1998 y 2010, lapso correspondiente a los periodos presidenciales de Andrés Pastrana Arango y Álvaro Uribe Vélez, actualmente opositores férreos a una salida negociada al conflicto colombiano.

Según cifras del Gobierno colombiano, en dicho periodo se registraron 5.827.898 víctimas directas de guerra, afectadas por situaciones de muerte, desplazamiento, secuestros y hambre. Este macabro número de víctimas sólo tuvo un giro durante el período presidencial 2010 – 2018, cuando el entonces Presidente Juan Manuel Santos, hoy Nobel de Paz, como jefe de Estado firmó el Acuerdo de Paz de La Habana, con el grupo guerrillero Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC – EP), hecho que contó con el respaldo de la comunidad internacional.

Mediante este Acuerdo de Paz, el Estado colombiano adquirió compromisos fundamentales, con el fin de lograr cambios sociales estructurales que permitieran luchar contra la desigualdad de la población y generar un ambiente de verdadera Paz.

Lamentablemente para la gran mayoría de la ciudadanía, las fuerzas políticas que durante años han promovido y conseguido su permanencia en el poder en Colombia, sustentadas en acciones de guerra y miedo, lograron retomar desde el año pasado la Presidencia de laRepublica, a través del hoy primer mandatario Iván Duque Márquez. Desde ese mismo momento, han sido muchos los ataques que ha recibido nuestra esperanza de lograr la Paz. Para ejemplificar, durante los primeros 8 meses del Gobierno actual, un total de 172 líderes sociales y defensoras de derechos humanos han sido asesinadas en Colombia, según informe del Instituto de Estudios sobre Paz y Desarrollo – Indepaz.

Así mismo, con el objetivo de afectar la Paz en Colombia, el mismo Presidente, su bancada aliada en el Congreso de la República y la Fiscalía General de la Nación (cooptada por las ya mencionadas fuerzas guerreristas), respaldados por la indebida intervención del Presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, en los asuntos internos de los colombianos, han dirigido ataques al Tribunal Especial para la Paz – JEP. Dicho tribunal es un organismo judicial que constituye el corazón de los Acuerdos de Paz (noviembre 2016), al ser el encargado de investigar los hechos de violencia y de buscar la Justicia, Verdad y Reparacion para las víctimas del conflicto Armado.

Mediante los graves acontecimientos de los últimos días, el Gobierno Nacional de Colombia y sus aliados políticos, han demostrado que sus intereses personales están por encima del bienestar de todo un país. Por este motivo los colombianos nos vemos en la imperiosa necesidad de hacer todo lo posible para impedir que se imponga la agenda política que perpetúa la guerra y que impide el ejercicio de la democracia.

Por las razones expuestas, pedimos la solidaridad de la Comunidad Internacional y a los líderes del mundo que han sido nuestros aliados en la consecución de la Paz en Colombia, para que nos respalden en nuestros siguientes propósitos:

Que la PAZ no nos cueste la vida ni la libertad.

GOVERN DE COLÒMBIA: DOBLE DISCURS I TRAICIÓ ALS ACORDS DE PAU

Les ciutadanies lliures de Colòmbia, unides per voluntat pròpia, amb l’anhel de construir un futurmillor per a les generacions que han de venir, manifestem a l’opinió pública internacional que:

Cap colombià ha viscut en pau al nostre país. Tots som o hem estat víctimes de la violència. Unaviolència causada per la concentració permanent del poder polític en mans d’uns pocs sectorseconòmicament privilegiats, que han fet servir les lleis en benefici propi, condemnant a la majoria de la població a la pobresa més deshonrosa.

La desigualtat social causada per les males pràctiques polítiques ha estat el que, principalment, ha alimentat la guerra, que a la vegada ha provocat milers de morts durant molts d’anys.

Una de les etapes més violentes de la nostra història recent va transcórrer durant els anys de 1998 a 2010, durant els períodes presidencials d’Andrés Pastrana Arango i Álvaro Uribe Vélez,en l’actualitat oposats fèrriament a una sortida negociada del conflicte colombià.

Segons xifres del Govern colombià, en aquesta etapa es varen registrar 5.827.989 víctimes de guerra directes, afectades per situacions de mort, desplaçament, segrest i fam. Aquest macabre número de víctimes només va tenir un tomb durant el període president del 2010 al 2018, quanl’ aleshores President Juan Manuel Santos, avui Nobel de la Pau, va signar com Cap d’Estat l’Acord de Pau de l’Habana amb el grup guerriller Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC-EP), fet que va comptar amb el recolzament de la comunitat internacional.

Va ser per aquest Acord de Pau que l’Estat colombià va adquirir compromisos fonamentals per tal d’aconseguir canvis socials estructurals que permetessin lluitar contra la desigualtat de lapoblació i generar un ambient de Pau veritable.

Lamentablement per a la gran majoria de la ciutadania, les forces polítiques que durant anys han procurat i aconseguit romandre en el poder a Colòmbia, sostinguts en accions de guerra ipor, varen aconseguir reprendre, des de l’any passat, la Presidència de la República a través delque avui és el primer mandatari Iván Duque Márquez. Des d’aquest mateix moment, han estat molts els atacs que ha rebut la nostra esperança d’aconseguir la Pau. Per exemple, durant elsprimers 8 mesos del Govern actual, un total de 172 líders socials i defensores de drets humans han estat assassinats a Colòmbia, segons informe de l’Instituto de Estudios sobre Paz y Desarrollo – Indepaz.Així mateix, amb l’objectiu d’afectar la Pau a Colòmbia, el mateix President, la seva bancadaaliada en el Congrés de la República i la Fiscalia General de la Nació (cooptada per les anomenades forces guerrillistes) recolzats per una intervenció indeguda del President d’EstatsUnits, Donald Trump, en els assumptes interns colombians, han dirigit atacs al Tribunal Especial para al Paz – JEP. Aquest tribunal és un organisme judicial que constitueix el cor dels Acords dePau, ja que és l’encarregat d’investigar els actes de violència y de buscar la Justíca, Veritat iReparació per a les víctimes del conflicte Armat.

Per mitjà dels greus esdeveniments dels últims dies, el Govern Nacional de Colòmbia i els seus aliats polítics, han demostrar que els seus interessos personals estan per sobre el benestar de tot un país.

Per aquest motiu els colombians ens veiem en la imperiosa necessitat de fer tot el possible pertal d’impedir que s’imposi l’agenda política que perpetua la guerra i que impedeix l’exercici dela democràcia.

Per totes les raons exposades, demanem solidàriament a la Comunitat internacional i als líders del món que han estat els nostres aliats en la consecució de la pau a Colòmbia, que ens recolzin en els següents propòsits:

1.- Que es brindin garanties a líders socials, defensors i defensores de Drets Humans, reclamants de terres, ex combatents de grups guerrillers reinserits i civils, que sistemàticament estan essent assassinats al nostre país.

2.- Que siguin respectats i s’acompleixin els Acords de Pau subscrits per l’Estat colombià amb l’extint grup guerriller de las FARC-EP.

3.- Que el Govern Nacional de Colòmbia reprengui les converses de Pau amb el grup guerrillerEjército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) per tal d’aconseguir una Pau veritable, estable i duradora.

4.- Que sigui respectada la Justicia Especial de Paz-JEP, que busca investigar i aclarir els crims de guerra comesos per tots els actors del conflicte a Colòmbia.

5.- Que sigui respectada la vida i es garanteixi les condicions per a la participació de l’oposiciópolítica.

6.- Que sigui respectada la independència judicial a Colòmbia.

Que la PAU no ens costi la vida ni la llibertat.

GREEK

Κυβέρνηση της Κολομβίας: η διγλωσσία της και η εκ μέρους της προδοσία της Συμφωνίας Ειρήνης

Οι ελεύθεροι πολίτες της Κολομβίας ενωμένοι με την θέληση μας, με μεγάλη όρεξη να φτιάξουμε ένα καλύτερο μέλλον για τις επόμενες γενιές, δηλώνουμε στην κοινή γνώμη ότι: κανένας άνθρωπος γεννημένος στην Κολομβία δεν έχει γνωρίσει την Ειρήνη. Όλοι είμαστε ή έχουμε υπάρξει θύματα της βίας. Μια βία που προέρχεται από τη συνεχή συγκέντρωση της πολιτικής εξουσίας στα χέρια λίγων οικονομικά προνομιούχων τομέων, οι οποίοι χρησιμοποιούσαν τους νόμους για ίδιον όφελος, καταδικάζοντας το μεγαλύτερο κομμάτι του πληθυσμού στην εξαθλίωση. Η μεγάλη κοινωνική ανισότητα προερχόμενη από τις κακές πολιτικές πρακτικές και αποφάσεις, τροφοδοτούσε τον πόλεμο και ταυτόχρονα προκάλεσε χιλιάδες θανάτους κατά τη διάρκεια όλων αυτών των χρόνων.

Μία από τις πιο βίαιες περιόδους της σύγχρονης Ιστορίας μας ήταν μεταξύ του 1998 και του 2010, περίοδος που αντιστοιχεί στην προεδρία του Αντρές Παστράνα Αράνγκο και του Άλβαρο Ουρίμπε Βέλες οι οποίοι σήμερα είναι οι κυριότεροι και πιο φαντικοί αντίπαλοι των ειρηνευτικών συνομιλιών που θα μας έβγαζαν από τον εμφύλιο πόλεμο.

Σύμφωνα με τους αριθμούς της κολομβιανής Κυβέρνησης, στη διάρκεια αυτής της περιόδου καταγράφονται 5.827.898 άμεσα θύματα του πολέμου, νεκροί, μετανάστες, θύματα απαγωγής και πείνας. Αυτός ο μακάβριος αριθμός θυμάτων άλλαξε μόνο κατά τις προεδρικές θητείες της περιόδου 2010-2018, όταν ο τότε πρόεδρος Χουάν Μανουέλ Σάντος –κάτοχος σήμερα του Νόμπελ Ειρήνης– υπέγραψε, ως ηγέτης του κράτους, τη συμφωνία Ειρήνης στην Αβάνα από κοινού με την αντάρτικη ομάδα FARC (Επαναστατικές Ένοπλες Δυνάμεις της Κολομβίας), γεγονός που είχε την υποστήριξη της Διεθνούς Κοινότητας. Με αυτή την Συμφωνία Ειρήνης, το κολομβιανό κράτος ανέλαβε σημαντικές δεσμεύσεις, με στόχο την επίτευξη ριζικών κοινωνικών αλλαγών. Οι οποίες θα επιτρέπαν την καταπολέμηση της ανισότητας και τη δημιουργία ενός αληθινά ειρηνικού περιβάλλοντος.

Δυστυχώς για το μεγαλύτερο μέρος των πολιτών, οι πολιτικές δυνάμεις που για χρόνια είχαν επιτύχει να παραμείνουν στην εξουσία -βασισμένες σε πολεμικές στρατηγικές εκφοβισμού- κατάφεραν να ξαναπάρουν την Προεδρία, με επικεφαλής τον σημερινό πρόεδρο Ιβάν Ντούκε Μάρκες. Από εκείνη την στιγμή πολλαπλασιάστηκαν οι επιθέσεις κατά της ελπίδας για Ειρήνη.

Για παράδειγμα: κατά τους 8 πρώτους μήνες της σημερινής κυβέρνησης, συνολικά 172 κοινωνικοί ηγέτες και υπερασπιστές των Ανθρωπίνων Δικαιωμάτων έχουν δολοφονηθεί στην Κολομβία, σύμφωνα με την έκθεση του Ινστιτούτου Σπουδών για την Ειρήνη και την Ανάπτυξη (INDEPAZ).

Ταυτόχρονα, με σκοπό να βλάψουν την Ειρήνη, ο ίδιος ο Πρόεδρος, η κοινοβουλευτική ομάδα του, η Γενική Εισαγγελία του Κράτους (οι οποίοι έχουν επιρροή στις φιλοπολεμικές δυνάμεις) και στηριζόμενοι από την παρέμβαση του Προέδρου των Ηνωμένων Πολιτειών Ντόναλντ Τράμπ στα εσωτερικά θέματα της χώρας, έχουν ενορχηστρώσει επιθέσεις εναντίον του Ειδικού Δικαστηρίου για την Ειρήνη (JEP). Το συγκεκριμένο Δικαστήριο είναι ένας δικαστικός οργανισμός που «οικοδομεί» τον πυρήνα των συνομιλιών για την Ειρήνη, έχοντας σαν στόχο τηνΜάϊος 20191έρευνα των βίαιων γεγονότων και επιδιώκοντας την Δικαιοσύνη, την αλήθεια και τις αποζημιώσεις των θυμάτων της ένοπλης σύγκρουσης.

Τις τελευταίες ημέρες, με πολύ σοβαρά γεγονότα, η κυβέρνηση της Κολομβίας και οι πολιτικοί σύμμαχοι της, έχουν καταδείξει τα πραγματικά συμφέροντα τους, τα οποία τοποθετούν πάνω από τα συμφέροντα της χώρας. Γι’ αυτόν τον λόγο, εμείς οι Κολομβιανοί, είναι υπέρτατη ανάγκη να κάνουμε, ότι είναι δυνατόν, για να αποτρέψουμε την κυριαρχία αυτής της πολιτικής ατζέντας που θέλει να διαιωνίσει τον πόλεμο και που θέλει να αποτρέψει την άσκηση της Δημοκρατίας.

Εξαιτίας αυτών, θέλουμε να ζητήσουμε την αλληλεγγύη της Διεθνούς Κοινότητας και των παγκόσμιων ηγετών, που ήταν πάντα στο πλευρό μας στην επίτευξη της Ειρήνης στην Κολομβία, να συνεχίσουν να μας συμπαραστέκονται βοηθώντας μας στα εξής θέματα:

1. Να υπάρξουν εγγυήσεις για τους κοινωνικούς ηγέτες και ηγέτιδες, για τους υπερασπιστές των Ανθρωπίνων Δικαιωμάτων, γι’ αυτούς που διεκδικούν τη γη, για τους πρώην αντάρτες και για τους απλούς πολίτες που συστηματικά δολοφονούνται στην χώρα μας.

2. Να γίνουν σεβαστές και να εκπληρωθούν οι συνομιλίες Ειρήνης που υπογράφηκαν με το πρώην αντάρτικο FARC -EPE.

3. Η κυβέρνηση της Κολομβίας να επιστρέψει στο τραπέζι του διαλόγου με την αντάρτικη ομάδα «Στρατός της Εθνικής Απελευθέρωσης» (ELN), με σκοπό να επιτευχθεί μία αληθινή Ειρήνη, σταθερή και διαρκής.

4. Να γίνει σεβαστό το Ειδικό Δικαστήριο για την Ειρήνη (JEP) το οποίο ερευνά την εξιχνίαση των εγκλήματων πολέμου από όλους τους παράγοντες της ένοπλης σύγκρουσης.

5. Να υπάρξει σεβασμός προς την ανθρώπινη ζωή και εγγυήσεις για την άσκηση της πολιτικής αντιπολίτευσης.

6. Να υπάρξει σεβασμός προς την δικαστική ανεξαρτησία της Κολομβίας.

Τέλος, η Ειρήνη να πάψει να μας κοστίζει ανθρώπινες ζωές, αλλά και την Ελευθερία την ίδια.

GOVERNO COLOMBIANO: DOPPIA MORALE E TRADIMENTO AGLI ACCORDI DI PACE

Noi, cittadini e cittadine libere della Colombia, uniti dalla nostra volontà e desiderio di costruire un futuro migliore per le generazioni future, dichiariamo all'opinione pubblica internazionale che:

Nessun colombiano è mai vissuto in pace nel nostro Paese. Tutti siamo o siamo stati vittime della violenza. Una violenza causata dalla perenne concentrazione del potere politico nelle mani di ridotti settori economicamente privilegiati, che hanno usato le leggi a proprio vantaggio, condannando la maggioranza della popolazione alla povertà più disonorevole. L'ineguaglianza sociale causata da queste perverse pratiche politiche è da sempre stata il principale motore della guerra che, a sua volta, ha prodotto migliaia di morti nel corso degli anni.

Una delle fasi più violente vissute nella nostra storia recente, tra il 1998 e il 2010, corrisponde ai governi di Andrés Pastrana Arango e Álvaro Uribe Vélez, attualmente accaniti avversari dell'Accordo di Pace, risultato dalla volontá delle parti di trovare una via di uscita negoziata al conflitto colombiano.

Secondo le cifre del Governo colombiano, solo durante questo periodo, ci sono state 5.827.898 vittime dirette del conflitto, colpite da morte, sfollamenti, rapimenti, obblio e fame. Questa macabro tendenza del numero di vittime ha avuto un rallentamento solo durante il periodo 2010-2018, quando l'allora presidente Juan Manuel Santos, oggi premio Nobel per la pace, ha intrapreso i negoziati e firmato l'accordo di pace, con la guerriglia delle FARC (Forze armate rivoluzionarie della Colombia), e determinante sostegno da parte della comunità internazionale.

Attraverso questo Accordo di Pace, lo Stato colombiano ha assunto impegni fondamentali al fine di realizzare cambiamenti sociali strutturali che permettessero di combattere l'ineguaglianza della popolazione e generare un'atmosfera di vera pace.

Sfortunatamente per la grande maggioranza dei cittadini, le forze politiche che tradizoonalmente grazie alle azioni militari e il terrore hanno concentrato il potere, e che hanno trovato nella guerra una strategia per mentenersi ad esso afferrato, sono riuscite lo scorso anno a riprendere la presidenza della Repubblica, dopo l'elezione dell’attuale presidente, Iván Duque Márquez.Da quel momento, la nostra speranza di raggiungere la Pace ha ricevutomolti attacchi. Per dare l’idea, secondo un rapporto dell'Istituto di studi sullaPace e lo Sviluppo – Indepaz, nei primi 8 mesi dell'attuale governo, ben 172 leader sociali e difensori dei diritti umani sono stati assassinati in Colombia. Inoltre, con l'obiettivo di sabotare il progetto della Pace, lo stesso Presidente, assieme al suo gruppo parlamentare e la figura ambigua del; ex Procuratore Generale, Nestor Humberto Martinez, e con la complicità interventista del Presidente degli Stati Uniti, Donald Trump, ha intrapreso una campagna di attacchi sistematici contro la Giustizia Speciale per la Pace - JEP, che rappresenta uno dei tre pillastri del sistema transizionale accordato e, proprioper quello, la più grande speranza per le vittime di accedere alla Verità, Giustizia e Riparazione Integrale.

I gravi eventi degli ultimi giorni che lo hanno visto protagonista, hanno dimostrato che al Presidente Duque e i suoi alleati politici, interessano di più i propri affari personali, che il benessere dell'intero popolo desideroso di pace. Per questo motivo noi, i cittadini e le cittadine colombiani che crediamo e costruiamo la pace quotidianamente, ci vediamo nell'urgente necessità di rafforzare e articolare i nostri sforzi per impedire al governo di imporci un'agenda politica orientata a perpetuare la guerra, e a ostacolare l'esercizio della democrazia, come l'unico percorso possibile per raggiungere la pace.

Lanciamo, dunque, un'appello alla Comunità Internazionale, ai leader e ai cittadini del mondo solidali con la nostra causa di difendere la pace in Colombia, di supportarci nel raggiungimento dei seguenti obiettivi:

1. Richiedere al governo misure effettive per preservare la vita dei leader sociali, difensori di diritti umani, vittime, ex combattenti e costruttori di pace in generale, che dalla firma dell'Accordo vengono sistematicamente assassinati nel nostro paese, impunemente.

2. Lavorare mancomunatamente affinchè gli accordi di pace che ha firmato lo Stato colombiano con le FARC-EP siano onorati integralmente e nei migliori dei modi possibile.

3. Pressionare affinché il governo colombiano riprenda al più presto i negoziati di pace con l'Esercito di liberazione nazionale (ELN), per avvanzare nella consecuzione di una pace completa, stabile e duratura.

4. Garantire rispetto totale e supporto per la Giustizia Speciale per la Pace - JEP, ideata proprio per sconfiggere l'impunità, indagare e chiarire le responsabilità penali per i crimini di guerra commessi da tutti gli attori del conflitto armato in Colombia.

5. Garantire il rispetto alla vita e offrire condizioni per la partecipazione dell'opposizione politica in Colombia.

6. Rispettare l'indipendenza del potere giudiziario colombiano, e lo Stato di Diritto.

Perché la pace non può costarci nè la la vita nè la libertà.

LE GOUVERNEMENT DE COLOMBIE : SON DOUBLE DISCOURS ET SA TRAHISON FACE AUX ACCORDS DE PAIX

Les citoyens libres de la Colombie, unis par leur propre volonté, désireux de construire un avenir meilleur pour les générations futures, nous manifestons à l'opinion publique internationale que :

Aucun Colombien n'a jamais vécu en paix dans notre pays. Nous sommes ou avons tous été victimes des violences. Une violence causée par la concentration permanente du pouvoir politique entre les mains de certains secteurs économiquement privilégiés, qui ont utilisé les lois pour leurs propres bénéfices, condamnant la majorité de la population à la pauvreté la plus déshonorante. L'inégalité sociale causée par de mauvaises pratiques politiques a été le principal conducteur de la guerre qui, à son tour, a fait des milliers de morts au fil des années.

L'une des étapes les plus violentes de notre histoire récente, s'est déroulée entre 1998 et 2010, période correspondant aux mandats présidentiels d'Andrés Pastrana Arango et Álvaro Uribe Vélez, qui s’opposent actuellement à une solutionnégociée face au conflit colombien.

Selon les chiffres du gouvernement colombien, 5 827 898 victimes directes de la guerre ont été enregistrées au cours de cette période, touchées par la mort, les déplacements, les enlèvements et la famine. Ce nombre macabre de victimes n'a changé qu'au cours du mandat présidentiel 2010-2018, lorsque le présidentJuan Manuel Santos, aujourd’hui ayant reçu le prix Nobel de la paix, a signél'Accord de paix à La Havane avec la guérilla des Forces armées révolutionnaires de Colombie (FARC-EP), un fait qui a obtenu le soutien de la communauté internationale.

Par cet accord de paix, l'État colombien a acquis des engagements fondamentaux, dans le but de réaliser des changements sociaux structurels qui permettraient de lutter contre l'inégalité de la population et de créer un climat de paix véritable.

Malheureusement pour la grande majorité des citoyens, les forces politiques qui depuis des années ont promu et obtenu leur permanence au pouvoir en Colombie, soutenues par des actions de guerre et de peur, ont réussi à reprendre depuis l'année dernière la Présidence de la République, à travers le président actuel Ivan Duque Marquez. À partir de ce moment précis, de nombreuses attaques ont été lancées contre notre espoir de parvenir à la paix. Par exemple, au cours des huit premiers mois du gouvernement actuel, 172 dirigeants sociauxet défenseurs des droits humains ont été assassinés en Colombie, selon un rapportde l'Institut d’études sur la paix et le développement- Indepaz.

De même, afin d'affecter la paix en Colombie, le Président lui-même, ses alliés au Congrès de la République et le bureau du Procureur général (coopté par les forces guerrières susmentionnées), appuyé par l'intervention indue du Président des États-Unis, Donald Trump, dans les affaires intérieures des Colombiens, ont dirigé des attaques contre le Tribunal spécial pour la paix - JEP. Ce tribunal est un organisme judiciaire qui constitue le cœur des Accords de Paix, puisqu'il estchargé d'enquêter sur les actes de violence et de rechercher justice, vérité et réparation pour les victimes du conflit armé.

Par les graves événements de ces derniers jours, le Gouvernement national colombien et ses alliés politiques ont démontré que leurs intérêts personnels l'emportent sur le bien-être de l'ensemble du pays.C'est pourquoi nous, Colombiens, nous nous voyons dans la nécessité de faire tout ce qui est en notre pouvoir pour empêcher l'imposition d'un programme politique qui perpétue la guerre et empêche l'exercice de la démocratie.

Pour ces raisons, nous demandons, la solidarité de la communauté internationale et aux leaders du monde qui ont été nos alliés dans la réalisation de la paix en Colombie, de nous soutenir dans nos objectifs suivants :

1. Que des garanties soient données aux dirigeants sociaux, aux défenseurs des droits humains, aux demandeurs de terres, aux ex-combattants des groupes de guérilla réinsérés et aux civils, qui ont été systématiquement assassinés dans notre pays.

2. Que les accords de paix signés par l'État colombien avec le groupe de guérilla FARC-EP soient respectés.

3. Que le Gouvernement national colombien reprenne les négociations de paix avec le groupe de guérilla Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN), dans le but d'instaurer une paix véritable, stable et durable.

4. Que soit respectée la Justice spéciale pour la paix - JEP, qui vise à enquêter sur les crimes de guerre commis par tous les acteurs dans le conflit en Colombie et à les élucider.

5. Que la vie soit respectée et que les conditions de participation de l'opposition politique soient garanties.

6. Que l'indépendance judiciaire soit respectée en Colombie.

Que la PAIX ne nous coûte pas nos vies et notre liberté.

DIE DOPPELZÜNGIGKEIT DER KOLUMBIANISCHEN REGIERUNG UND IHR VERRAT AM FRIEDENSABKOMMEN

Die freie Bürgerschaft Kolumbiens, vereint im starken Willen und Bestreben, für künftige Generationen eine bessere Zukunft zu schaffen, erklärt der Weltöffentlichkeit:

Keine Kolumbianerin und kein Kolumbianer hat in unserem Land in Frieden gelebt. Wir alle sind Gewaltopfer. Opfer einer Gewalt, verursacht durch die permanente Konzentration der politischen Macht in wenigen ökonomisch privilegierten Sektoren, die die Gesetze zu ihrem eigenen Profit nutzt und die Mehrheit der Bevölkerung zu unwürdigster Armut verurteilt. Die soziale Ungleichheit aufgrund der schlechten politischen Praktiken war der grundlegende Nährboden für den Krieg, der seinerseits im Lauf der Jahre Tausende Tote produzierte.

Eine der gewalttätigsten Perioden unserer neueren Geschichte war die Zeit von 1998 bis 2010, Präsidentschaft der beiden Ex-Präsidenten Andrés Pastrana Arango und Alvaro Uribe Vélez, die immer noch eiserne Gegner einer Verhandlungslösung im kolumbianischen Konflikt sind.

Gemäss Zahlen der kolumbianischen Regierung wurden während dieser Periode 5´827.898 direkte Kriegsopfer registriert, die von Tod, Vertreibung, Entführung und Hunger betroffen waren. Die makabre Anzahl von Opfern nahm drastisch ab während der Präsidentschaft 2010-2018, in der Präsident Juan Manuel Santos, heute Nobelpreisträger, als Staatschef das Friedensabkommen von Havanna mit der Guerillagruppe Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC-EP) unterzeichnete. Das Friedensabkommen fand Unterstützung in der internationalen Gemeinschaft.

Mit diesem Friedensabkommen ging der kolumbianische Staat grundlegende Verpflichtungen ein, strukturelle Veränderungen einzuleiten und umzusetzen mit dem Ziel, die ungleichen Lebensbedingungen für die Bevölkerung zu bekämpfen und ein Klima wahren Friedens zu schaffen.

Zum Unglück der grossen Mehrheit der Bevölkerung gelang es den politischen Kräften, die sich in Kolumbien mittels kriegerischer Aktionen und Einschüchterung über Jahre hatten an der Macht halten können, die Präsidentschaft  der Republik in Person des heutigen Amtsinhabers Iván Duque Márquez wieder zu übernehmen. Seitdem wurde unsere Hoffnung auf Frieden viele Male erschüttert. Beispielsweise wurden gemäss Indepaz, dem Institut für Studien zu Entwicklung und Frieden, während der ersten acht Monate der Präsidentschaft Duque 172 soziale Führer und Personen, die die Menschenrechte verteidigten, ermordet.

Mit der Absicht, den Frieden in Kolumbien zu stören, griff Präsident Duque zudem gemeinsam mit seiner Fraktion im Parlament der Republik und der Generalstaatsanwaltschaft – die von den vorher erwähnten kriegerischen Kräften bereits vereinnahmt worden war – die Sonderjustiz für den Frieden (JEP) an. Der Angriff wurde gestützt durch die rechtswidrige Einmischung des amerikanischen Präsidenten Donald Trump in die internen Angelegenheiten Kolumbiens.  JEP als eines der wichtigsten Instrumente des Friedensabkommens hat den Auftrag, die Gewalttaten zu untersuchen und für die Opfer des bewaffneten Konflikts Gerechtigkeit, Wahrheit und Wiedergutmachung herbeizuführen.

Mit den schlimmen Vorfällen der letzten Tage demonstrierten die kolumbianische Regierung und ihre politischen Verbündeten, dass sie ihre persönlichen Interessen über das Wohlergehen des Volkes stellen.

252,Stop including single use plastic cutlery in every fast food take out bag.,"Hundreds of take-out fast food restaurants across the country include single use plastic cutlery in the first step to banning unnecessary plastic waste. 
At each take out and fast food restaurant","['Chick-Fil-A', 'Whataburger', 'Sonic Drive-In', 'Taco Bell', 'Panda Express', ""McDonald's""]",Cynthia Carvajal,"Austin, TX, United States",85012,28 Jan 2020,https://assets.change.org/photos/8/vm/em/GCVMEmyArPFereo-800x450-noPad.jpg?1580246157,"Hundreds of take-out fast food restaurants across the country include single use plastic cutlery in a plastic bag with out the customer requesting they even need it for their meal. How many times have you taken the take-out home and use your own utensils and the plastic cutlery just gets thrown in a drawer, recycled or thrown in the trash if recycling isn't accessible?

A 2015 study by Ocean Conservancy scientists and partners found that plastic cutlery are among the most dangerous to ocean animals such as seabirds and turtles, especially as they break up into smaller microplastics. Single-use utensils can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. Most plastic utensils are made of polystyrene, which can release toxic chemicals when heated.

This petition is to create a law that would ban including single use plastic cutlery in all take out bags unless requested by the customer. This would help reduce the plastic waste as well as saving take out restaurants thousands of dollars in supply costs.

Some estimates put the number of individual plastic utensils wasted at 40 billion per year in the United States alone. The ultimate goal is to ban single use plastic completely but this would be the first step to banning unnecessary plastic waste.

At each take out and fast food restaurant, there would be a sign saying ""plastic cutlery not included in order and is by request only. Re-usable bamboo, wood or metal cutlery is recommended to help reduce plastic waste.""

Ideally, restaurants will start using biodegradable cutlery and/or sell bamboo cutlery kits to encourage customers to bring their own each time they eat a meal at a restaurant. This is a win win for restaurants, customers and the environment."

He has a record of Physically Abusing people before arrests without Reason. There are Documented Photos, Videos and Government Data to Prove that Officer Reiman went beyond his rights as an Officer and has been a Major Liability for the Police Department of Carteret, NJ.

With the assistance of his brother, MAYOR Daniel Reiman, he was brought back into the Police Department and given a promotion and pay raise, even after having multiple Aggravated Assault complaints filed against him. His complaints make up nearly all the Police Department complaints and yet, due to corruption, he continues to receive Tax Payer funded Paychecks and a Pension.

Because of this shunning down they isolate themselves and form small secret communities to protect themselves from disrespect and mistreatment. Since our society lacks acceptance for them, there are no ways for them to earn their livelihood through decent means; they hence deploy/ engage themselves in activities which are either considered taboo in our society or not respected, like dancing, singing, begging, prostitution - just to make both ends meet.

Although the Law doesn't state or encourage any discrimination at any level, we believe its more of a societal and cultural barrier to accept them as a third gender.

So lets make small efforts to include and welcome them as apart of the community and society that is created on the same grounds by the creator, with just a little biological difference - which is not their fault.

Can we try giving them a job? Can we make them learn a new skill? Can we give them basic education? In whatever capacity we can,  lets break this barrier one transgender at a time.

But the ones who are the hardest hit are the most vulnerable of us all: the migrant labourers, who work in big cities as daily wagers.

The lockdown means they’re out of work for the next 3 weeks. With no income they can’t afford food. Before the government could announce relief packages, lakhs of them with children in tow began heading back to their villages within and across state borders. On foot, as there is no public transport either. All they want is to get back safely to their homes in their village.Sign my petition asking the Central governments and state governments to coordinate a rescue and relief operation.

Doing so will require intense coordination across states, involving District Administrations. It is heartening to see that a few Chief Ministers have already begun reaching out to one another through social media.

Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh (where I am from), Odisha, Jharkhand, Delhi, and Punjab are already coordinating among themselves. This rescue, relief and support operation needs to involve multiple states.

The U.S. government has demonstrated that it is unwilling and unable to protect African-Americans from deadly police violence and violent white extremism nor deliver justice when we are viciously massacred. George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery were murdered by deadly police violence and violent white extremist vigilantism, respectively. Thousands of African-American men and women, particularly youth, have been mercilessly killed by police and armed white bands.

America's pathology of violence against Black Americans has created existential threats to Black life and liberty including but not limited to systematic and structural racial discrimination, violent white extremism, extra-judicial killings and deadly police violence and it’s antecedents.

The Trump Administration is encouraging racial division, deadly police violence and white vigilante justice against African-Americans and their allies. The American judiciary has summarily failed to protect black lives and the Congress is largely impotent.

Hence, as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. indicated, it is time to indict the United States at the global level in the United Nations for violating the fundamental human rights of Black Americans.

259,Année Blanche pour les Intermittents du Spectacle,"Madame et Messieurs les Ministres,
Depuis le début du confinement, syndicats, associations, collectifs, groupes, en un mot les intermittents du spectacle ne cessent de vous solliciter au vu de l’urgence de la PRÉCARITÉ dans laquelle le COVID 19 nous plonge. Sans grande avancée.
TROP D’INTERMITTENTS NE TOUCHENT PAS LEURS ALLOCATIONS AU CHOMAGE. Pourquoi ? Parce que nous travaillons « TROP RÉGULIÈREMENT » et que nous sommes en CARENCE !
MAIS COMMENT FAIRE POUR PAYER CHARGES, LOYERS, CREDITS, COMMENT PEUT-ON VIVRE SANS REVENU ?
     Nous sommes les techniciens, les artistes du spectacle vivant, ceux qui fleurissent les scènes de festivals, de théâtres, de concerts. Mais aussi les techniciens, les artistes travaillant sur les films, les clips, les documentaires et les séries que l’on s’arrache à la TV ou sur les plateformes du web. Ou encore ceux travaillant sur les films publicitaires qui donnent un rayonnement national et international aux plus grandes marques françaises, qui nourrissent l’audiovisuel ou le web. Et pour finir, les techniciens et les artistes d’une INDUSTRIE, celle DU CINEMA, qui occupe 39% de part de marché en 2018 sur la scène mondiale.
     Vous le savez, nous avons en France un savoir-faire que l’on s’arrache.
     AUJOURD’HUI, NOTRE VISIBILITÉ PROFESSIONNELLE EST NULLE (contre 6 mois à 3 ans selon les secteurs). En quelques heures, tout s’est effondré. Les administrations que nous interrogeons travaillent sur les sorties possibles du confinement mais ne sont pas rassurantes. Elles nous annoncent des mois de blocage avant une reprise TRÈS progressive de nos secteurs d’activités. Et l’impossibilité de tourner ou d’effectuer des tournées pendant des mois, voire plus.
     Aujourd’hui, pour toute réponse à la précarité, nous avons droit à deux lignes sur la page d’accueil de Pôle Emploi. Et un vague décret qui occulte totalement le principe de franchise et de carence bloquant l’accès à toute indemnisation, alors que nous sommes en pleine pandémie :

Report de date anniversaire au 31 mai 2020 uniquement pour les personnes ayant eu leur recalcul de droits pendant la période de confinement,
Chômage partiel pour une poignée d’intermittents ayant reçu un contrat signé.

     Vous avez étendu le chômage partiel en soulignant l’urgence de la situation. Cette mesure ne concerne qu’une catégorie d’intermittents qui avaient un contrat de travail en cours ou une promesse d’embauche formelle. Qu’en est-il pour l’immense majorité qui ne bénéficiera jamais de ces mesures parce que tous les projets pour lesquels elle était optionnée ont été annulé du jour au lendemain ? Et que nos employeurs se sont retrouvés démunis face à la soudaineté de la mesure adoptée par le gouvernement ?
     Une pincée de mesures pour une minorité et qui laisse la majorité d’entre nous sur «le bord de la route », alors QU’IL EST URGENT DE PRENDRE LA SPÉCIFICITÉ DE NOS SECTEURS D’ACTIVITÉ ET DE NOTRE REGIME EN COMPTE !
     L’application des franchises salaires selon les dispositions de l’accord de mai 2016 combinée au mode de calcul de nos allocations journalières et à la durée de notre indemnisation nous met aujourd’hui, en période de « CARENCE » et nous prive de revenus décents. En pleine pandémie, cela impacte dangereusement nos vies.
1- Toute FRANCHISE non appliquée s’ajoute à celle du mois suivant et ainsi de suite. Le principe de l’intermittence est d‘enchaîner des contrats souvent courts. Une période travaillée dans le mois ne donne pas droit aux indemnités ni même à la déduction des franchises.
     A cause de ce principe de report de franchises, la plupart des intermittents sont, depuis le début du confinement, en période de carence et perçoivent très peu voir aucune Allocation Journalière.
     La règle de calcul de franchises appliquée uniquement sur les intermittents du spectacle nous pénalise injustement. Si vous faites trop d’heures l’année qui précède, ces franchises peuvent dépasser les 200 jours (soit 7 mois) à déduire sur les 12 mois suivants. Alors qu’au Régime général ce plafond de franchises est de 150 jours pour un salaire dix fois supérieur.
     Cette différentiation, si elle est justifiée du fait de notre statut particulier, est totalement DISPROPORTIONNÉE comparée au Régime Général.
2- Ceci n’étant pas aidé par le montant très bas des Allocations Journalières. La fameuse formule tripartite utilisée dans le calcul des indemnités des intermittents engendre des AJ fortement inférieures au salaire journalier de référence. Tout salaire au dessus de 14.400 € brut annuel (pour l’annexe 8, techniciens) et 13.700€ brut annuel (pour l’annexe 10, Artistes) compte pour 5%. Et toute heure au dessus de 720 heures, compte très peu. Contre 11.784€ brut MENSUEL au Régime Général.
3- La nouvelle date anniversaire s’appuyant toujours sur le dernier contrat travaillé, si la reprise de nos secteurs s’effectuait en octobre 2020, il ne serait pas réaliste de demander alors à un intermittent de faire 507 heures entre octobre 2020 et février ou mars 2021. Et surtout il n’y aurait pas assez de jours ouvrés.
     Tout comme pour ceux qui n’auraient pas pu cumuler leurs 507 heures en raison de l’ARRET TOTAL de leur secteur d’activité. Ces intermittents vont se retrouver sans aucune source de revenu.
4 – Pour en finir sur les aberrations dont nous sommes victimes, le remboursement des indus va nous étrangler dans les mois à venir. En effet, Pôle Emploi indique en fin de Notification de Décision que « Si au terme de l'indemnisation les franchises n'ont pu être intégralement appliquées, vous nous devrez la somme équivalente aux jours de franchises restants sur la base de votre allocation journalière déterminée à l'ouverture de droits, dans la limite de ce que vous avez perçu. »
     Lorsque nous arrivons en fin de droits, Pôle Emploi réclame régulièrement une partie des sommes versées pendant l’année. Sommes sur lesquelles nous payons injustement des impôts. Qu’en est-il de cette règle sur les prochains ré-examens de fin de droits ?
     Madame et Messieurs les Ministres, il convient de rappeler que loin des clichés sur les Intermittents du Spectacle et selon les chiffres fournis par Pôle Emploi, seuls 38 % des intermittents sont indemnisés. Les 62 % restants cotisent régulièrement pour notre régime d’assurance chômage mais ne bénéficient pas des indemnisations à cause d'un nombre d'heures insuffisant. Nous parlons donc d’une poignée de travailleurs au regard de tout un pays. Paradoxalement, depuis janvier 2019, nous sommes les derniers salariés de France à cotiser à l’assurance chômage. Alors pourquoi en cette période de confinement ne bénéficions-nous pas du même soutien que les autres salariés français ?
     Nous vivons la situation actuelle comme UNE EXCLUSION alors que nous devrions être considérés comme une exception !
 
DONNEZ-NOUS UNE ANNÉE BLANCHE !
 
     Madame Muriel Pénicaud, nous vous demandons  urgemment :
1.   De prendre acte des réelles implications que ce confinement entraîne pour l’ensemble des intermittents du spectacle, en demandant à l’Unedic d’annuler l’application des franchises à partir du premier jour officiel de confinement, jusqu’à la reprise réelle de nos secteurs d’activités, et sans application de report,
2.   De compenser les allocations journalières reçues par une somme s’approchant du salaire de référence de chaque intermittent, comme c’était le cas avant 2016, et comme c’est le cas dans le Régime Général aujourd’hui,
3.   De reconduire les dates anniversaires de chacun de 12 mois, à partir de la reprise d’activités de nos différents secteurs et non de les calculer au dernier contrat signé,
4.   De prévoir un régime dérogatoire pour les intermittents qui exceptionnellement n’obtiendraient pas suffisamment d’heures, pour les femmes qui sont ou seront en congés de maternité dans l’année, pour les techniciens et artistes qui sont en arrêt maladie,
5.   De stopper définitivement les réclamations par Pôle Emploi des indus lorsque nous arrivons en fin de droits.       
 
     Monsieur Franck Riester, à nous de vous demander un « petit effort ». Valorisez-nous aux yeux de notre gouvernement au lieu de nous dénigrer par votre silence. Actuellement, vous laissez des milliers d’intermittents dans une situation dramatique alors que vous avez annoncé que personne ne resterait sur le bord de la route. Certains d’entre eux ont actuellement la chance ou la malchance de ne pas être confinés puisqu’ils vont chaque jour à Radio France ou sur les plateaux télévisés. Ils y vont bille en tête, convaincus que ces moyens de communication sont les derniers liens entre votre gouvernement et les Français. S’ils en venaient à vouloir soutenir les autres intermittents par une grève, c’est une MIRE que vous aurez demain sur les écrans télévisés.
 
     Que le Gouvernement d’une manière générale et Monsieur Edouard Philippe s’engagent à assumer les conséquences d’un confinement qui impacte nos secteurs d’activités comme nul autre en France. Le monde de l’audiovisuel, du cinéma et du spectacle est par définition synonyme de rassemblement. Il est plongé aujourd’hui dans un coma dont on ne sait quand ni comment il s’en sortira sans VOTRE SOUTIEN.
 
     Si vous ne réagissez pas, c’est un champ de bataille au lendemain de guerre auquel vous assisterez impuissants dans un an. Un pays perdu, sans âme. Alors que plus que jamais, notre pays aura besoin de spectacles, de films, de musique, de festivals, de rires et de rêve !
 
     C’est maintenant que ce nouveau souffle se construit. Avec vous.
 
     Alors Madame et Messieurs les Ministres, nous sommes des milliers d’intermittents du spectacle à vous dire : EN MARCHE !

Alors pourquoi en cette période de confinement ne bénéficions-nous pas du même soutien que les autres salariés français ?

Nous vivons la situation actuelle comme UNE EXCLUSION alors que nous devrions être considérés comme une exception !



DONNEZ-NOUS UNE ANNÉE BLANCHE !



Madame Muriel Pénicaud, nous vous demandons  urgemment :

1.   De prendre acte des réelles implications que ce confinement entraîne pour l’ensemble des intermittents du spectacle, en demandant à l’Unedic d’annuler l’application des franchises à partir du premier jour officiel de confinement, jusqu’à la reprise réelle de nos secteurs d’activités, et sans application de report,

2.   De compenser les allocations journalières reçues par une somme s’approchant du salaire de référence de chaque intermittent, comme c’était le cas avant 2016, et comme c’est le cas dans le Régime Général aujourd’hui,

3.   De reconduire les dates anniversaires de chacun de 12 mois, à partir de la reprise d’activités de nos différents secteurs et non de les calculer au dernier contrat signé,

4.   De prévoir un régime dérogatoire pour les intermittents qui exceptionnellement n’obtiendraient pas suffisamment d’heures, pour les femmes qui sont ou seront en congés de maternité dans l’année, pour les techniciens et artistes qui sont en arrêt maladie,

5.   De stopper définitivement les réclamations par Pôle Emploi des indus lorsque nous arrivons en fin de droits.



Monsieur Franck Riester, à nous de vous demander un « petit effort ». Valorisez-nous aux yeux de notre gouvernement au lieu de nous dénigrer par votre silence. Actuellement, vous laissez des milliers d’intermittents dans une situation dramatique alors que vous avez annoncé que personne ne resterait sur le bord de la route. Certains d’entre eux ont actuellement la chance ou la malchance de ne pas être confinés puisqu’ils vont chaque jour à Radio France ou sur les plateaux télévisés. Ils y vont bille en tête, convaincus que ces moyens de communication sont les derniers liens entre votre gouvernement et les Français. S’ils en venaient à vouloir soutenir les autres intermittents par une grève, c’est une MIRE que vous aurez demain sur les écrans télévisés.



Que le Gouvernement d’une manière générale et Monsieur Edouard Philippe s’engagent à assumer les conséquences d’un confinement qui impacte nos secteurs d’activités comme nul autre en France. Le monde de l’audiovisuel, du cinéma et du spectacle est par définition synonyme de rassemblement. Il est plongé aujourd’hui dans un coma dont on ne sait quand ni comment il s’en sortira sans VOTRE SOUTIEN.



Si vous ne réagissez pas, c’est un champ de bataille au lendemain de guerre auquel vous assisterez impuissants dans un an. Un pays perdu, sans âme. Alors que plus que jamais, notre pays aura besoin de spectacles, de films, de musique, de festivals, de rires et de rêve !



C’est maintenant que ce nouveau souffle se construit. Avec vous.



Alors Madame et Messieurs les Ministres, nous sommes des milliers d’intermittents du spectacle à vous dire : EN MARCHE !



On compte sur vous.

Les Intermittents du Spectacle.

I've been working in mental health for many years now, dealing with issues like clinical depression and anxiety, but I and many colleagues have seen a worrying spike in enquiries for psychotherapy over the last five months.

A deterioration of mental health is linked to increased isolation, bereavement, unemployment and financial insecurity - and the problem may well increase when the furlough scheme ends this autumn. We need an urgent mental health plan to deal with this crisis.

Younger adults, women, key workers and disabled people are among those most likely to suffer depression during the pandemic. Whilst the Office of National Statistics report also warns that inequalities in accessing services and recovery rates that black and minority ethnic communities already face will be made even worse.

The initial fire was responded to by the Fire Brigade who gave the ‘all clear’ for the family to return, only for a second fire incident to be discovered within the hour after the family had returned.  The fire gutted the top floor and the roof.  This has destroyed their home and their livelihood, causing massive trauma to the family which includes 3 elders, one of whom has serious mental health needs and two with significant disabilities and mobility issues.  Read the article about us in the Bristol Post . The authorities declared the structure unsound and uninhabitable, which meant that on the night of the fire, the 3 elders were only offered the floor of a greasy takeaway to sleep on, with no adequate support over the weekend by the council. The police have been bringing vulnerable members of the public to stay at the Guest House for years, but on this occasion, the favour was not returned. The family have now been given temporary housing for the week (a room shared by 4 adults in a hotel just outside the city). Whilst helping the Police with queries the next day, the police mysteriously held one of the members of the family for questioning without heeding to requests for an interpreter, chaperone, or a solicitor. They were asked if they wanted to be returned to Indonesia and asked questions unrelated to the arson. This only compounded the trauma they already faced from the fire.

The family has been subjected to racism, xenophobia and specifically sinophobia which has intensified over the past 3 years of pandemic, including racist graffiti, vandalisation, intentional flooding, acts and threats of physical violence and/or shouting racist abuse. Guests have trespassed and/or stolen items. False flag reports on anti-terror and the Home Office, leading to dozens of unsolicited raids. Countless times, the police have been called out to attend due to guests’ physical aggression and significant threats to life against the family. A recent incident involved a man chasing a family member around the house with a large knife. Reviews and comments made about Alpha Guest House often resort to insulting the family’s lack of fluency in English, making scathing remarks about their Chinese / Asian heritage, and enacting tropes by complaining about weird smells, behaviours, and accents. Non-white guests often face disproportionate surveillance and scrutiny from the local authorities. The family feels let down by the local authorities. This fire is the latest in a long line of traumatic events. No other guest house, hotel, business, or home in the white-majority area has been treated in this manner.

We demand that:

Along with thousands of others, I was part of the successful campaign to stop Shell’s Cambo oil field – a huge proposed oil development off the coast of Scotland.

Last year, oil and gas giants announced record profits, whilst millions were being forced into fuel poverty (caused by our dependence on fossil fuels!). The UK government’s response? To quietly continue greenlighting more oil & gas projects in the North Sea, which will only boost their profits while doing nothing to lower energy bills. By approving these fields, the UK government has yet again placed the short-term profits of oil companies over the future of all life on earth.

And now, the UK government wants to approve the biggest undeveloped oil and gas field in the North Sea: Rosebank. The climate impacts of Rosebank would be catastrophic: the emissions from burning its oil and gas would be more than the annual CO2 emissions of the 28 lowest-income countries combined. In other words, this one UK field would produce more pollution than the world’s 700 million poorest people produce in a whole year.

And Rosebank won’t do anything to lower our energy bills, or boost our energy security. In fact, a project like Rosebank will have next to no public benefit; all it will do is make a few oil companies even richer. Rosebank’s owners - including Norwegian oil giant Equinor - stand to get a tax break worth over half a billion pounds from the UK public, just for developing the field.

It doesn’t end there. Rosebank is one of dozens of new fossil fuel projects that the UK government wants to approve before the next general election. This would lock us into an expensive, dirty energy source for decades longer than necessary. The fact that the vast bulk of these reserves are oil, which the UK exports overseas, means there is next to no public benefit from these projects. They absolutely can not be allowed to go ahead.

The solution to today’s energy crisis – and how we will ensure we don’t experience future crises – is to move the UK away from volatile oil and gas through insulating our draughty homes and switching to affordable, homegrown renewables, which we are lucky to have in abundance. But instead of fixing our broken energy system, by taking action to boost energy efficiency and rollout renewables, the government is more focused on helping the oil and gas industry expand drilling.

Millions of people in the UK now cannot afford to heat their homes because of soaring gas prices. The government needs to stop acting for the oil and gas companies and taking decisions that benefit their bottom line, and instead prioritise action that will bring down energy bills, which will help everyone.

We all want a liveable future - one where we have safe, clean, affordable energy that doesn’t pollute our lungs, threaten the balance of nature, or push millions of people into poverty. Many people in the UK came together to fight Cambo. Now we’re demanding an end to all new fossil fuel extraction.

We say no more. No more handouts for oil giants. No more skyrocketing energy bills. No more oil fields that ruin our chances at a liveable future.

I’m calling on the UK government to:

1. Reject all new and recently approved oil and gas fields and stop issuing licences for fossil fuel companies to search for more oil and gas.

2. Tax big polluters that made record profits this past year and use the money to support households across the UK.

3. Support oil and gas industry workers and affected communities to transition to renewable energy, making sure people can switch to sustainable, clean jobs as we move away from oil and gas.

We know what we have to do, and we have the solutions we need to get there. All we’re missing is leaders willing to act.

264,Stop Banning Gender Critical Voices on Twitter,,,Free Speech Union,United Kingdom,2825,"Nov. 24, 2022",https://assets.change.org/photos/4/jt/bb/gQjtBbAWrkiqeVS-800x450-noPad.jpg?1669313454,"Dear Elon Musk,

We are writing to urge you to restore the Twitter accounts of all the people who’ve been permanently banned for expressing gender critical beliefs, i.e., that sex is biological and immutable and not a social construct. We applaud your ambition to turn Twitter into a free speech platform, where a broad range of views can be discussed and debated in the digital town square, and welcome your reinstatement of numerous accounts, including that of the Canadian feminist Meghan Murphy. In light of this, there can be no justification for continuing to censor gender critical voices. It is time for Twitter to welcome back gender critical commentators like women’s rights activist Kellie-Jay Keen (@thePosieParker), comedy writer Graham Linehan (@glinner), intersex advocate Claire Graham (@MRKHvoice), barrister Dennis Kavanagh (@jebadoo2), journalist Miranda Yardley (@terrorizerMIR) and philosopher Holly Lawford-Smith (@aytchellesse).

Gender critical views are often characterised as ‘transphobic’, but none of these commentators hate trans people or oppose trans rights in general. Rather, they believe there are some areas in which trans rights clash with sex-based women’s rights – on the issue of whether transwomen should be admitted to women’s domestic violence shelters, for instance – and in those areas they believe women’s rights should take priority. Indeed, they believe the integrity of women’s rights are inextricably bound up with defining sex as biological and immutable and once you abandon that definition – by asserting that men who identify as women are ontologically indistinguishable from biological women – women’s rights become less secure.

Even though gender critical feminists believe sex-based women rights should take priority over trans rights, that doesn’t make them ‘transphobic’, any more than holding the opposite view makes a person ‘misogynistic’. Rather, they are opposing points of view rooted in two different understandings of how sex should be defined and what the implications are of accepting one definition and rejecting the other with respect to the admission of transwomen to women’s sports, women’s changing rooms and women’s prisons. Neither point of view should be condemned as ‘hate speech’. On the contrary, if we are to reach a settled consensus on these contested issues it is essential that both sides listen to each other and engage in dialogue. That’s why we think it’s so important that these accounts are reinstated.

That gender critical views are within the bounds of acceptable speech and worthy of respect in a democratic society – and not hateful or transphobic – is not just the opinion of the Free Speech Union, but has been confirmed by the Employment Appeals Tribunal. That tribunal recently concluded that gender critical beliefs are ‘protected’ under the Equality Act 2010, meaning it is unlawful in the UK to discriminate against people because they hold those beliefs. Although this hasn’t yet been tested in the European Court of Human Rights, we also think these beliefs are protected by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Some gender critical accounts have been taken down simply for asserting the view that sex should be defined biologically. Posts such as “Only females get cervical cancer”, “If you have a uterus you will be female”, “If you have periods you are a woman” and “Having a penis is what makes someone male” were all deemed by Twitter to be in violation of the platform’s rules against ‘hateful conduct’. But such views are not hateful. In banning gender critical accounts on the grounds that such views are ‘hateful’ – or banning accounts because they have ‘misgendered’ or ‘deadnamed’ trans people – Twitter is appealing to an imaginary consensus in favour of the view that it is transphobic to define sex as biological and immutable, or that self-declared gender identity should determine access to single sex spaces and services, or that people are entitled to compel others to use their preferred gender pronouns. No such consensus exists, which leads us to conclude that the reason so many gender critical accounts have been banned is because Twitter’s content moderators have taken the side of the transrights activists in this debate. If Twitter is to become the digital town square you want it to be, where free speech is sacrosanct, the moderators must remain above the fray when it comes to matters of ongoing public debate. They should act as holders of the ring, not political combatants.

We hope that you will recognise the cancellation of these accounts as an example of “censorship that goes far beyond law”, which you have rightly condemned. Public debate is impoverished when access to the digital town square is restricted in this way. As you say in your ‘hateful conduct’ policy, “Our role is to serve the public conversation, which requires representation of a diverse range of perspectives.” By reinstating gender critical accounts and recognising gender critical views as a legitimate contribution to an ongoing public debate, Twitter can take a meaningful step towards encouraging a civil discussion between people with opposing views on this important topic. It is only by protecting free speech and allowing open discussion and debate that we can hope to make progress towards resolving the most contentious disputes that are currently dividing us.

We ask you to restore all the accounts that have been banned because they fall foul of Twitter’s content moderation policy that wrongly characterises the expression of gender critical beliefs as ‘hateful’. We have compiled a list of accounts banned for this reason and are happy to share them with you if you contact us on info@freespeechunion.org."

President Obama and the NSA have stated that widespread spying of Americans is not taking place and that the government is only requesting certain data from these companies. There is an easy way to show if this is true and that companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter have taken the commendable step of requesting that the NSA allow them to publish the records of government data requests in their company transparency reports.

In part, Google's letter states:

Assertions in the press that our compliance with these requests gives the U.S. government unfettered access to our users’ data are simply untrue. However, government nondisclosure obligations regarding the number of FISA national security requests that Google receives, as well as the number of accounts covered by those requests, fuel that speculation.We therefore ask you to help make it possible for Google to publish in our Transparency Report aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosures—in terms of both the number we receive and their scope. Google’s numbers would clearly show that our compliance with these requests falls far short of the claims being made. Google has nothing to hide.

The government allowed Google to start reporting the number of national security letters they received requesting data earlier this year, but they are still barred from releasing information about Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) orders. The requests for this data often comes in the form of secret court orders that not only force these companies to give data but also make it impossible for them to discuss even the basic details. That should change.

By allowing these companies to include this information in their transparency reports, the government will be giving American citizens at least some of the insight we deserve about how our daily activities like emails and Google searches are being tracked by the government."

The impact of these proposed changes will be immense and disastrous. As hard-working members of society, small businesses provide the economic backbone of Canada. Small business owners receive none of the paid benefits that salaried employees do. The risks and costs of running a small business are high. Tax assistance is vital to ensure the survival of small businesses.

Our Canadian doctors are independent of the government and run their clinics like small businesses without any support from the government. Without pensions or any benefits, such as sick leave, maternity leave, health benefits or paid vacation, physicians must independently cover all of the costs of running their offices. Costs include staffing, rent, utilities, all medical equipment/diagnostics, and all medical supplies on top of mandatory licensing and registration fees. This overhead can be between 30-60%. There are 88,000 physicians in Canada and the majority are self-employed.  Each office employs on average 4-6 staff. This allows our physicians to run accessible and efficient offices to help patients obtain medically necessary care. Elimination of tax arrangements which were legally negotiated to help physicians control the expense of running offices will impact patients directly.

If these proposed taxation changes are passed, Canada’s doctors will be forced to downsize offices and lay off employees. Many provinces have had millions to billions in unilateral cuts to frontline patient care over the past few years. In Ontario alone, our doctors are now into their fourth year without a contract and there has been over $3.7 Billion unilaterally cut since 2015 by the provincial government from the patient services that our doctors provide. There are millions of patients in Canada without a family doctor and unprecedented wait times for specialists. Medical clinics are already struggling to stay afloat. With these federal tax changes, our physicians will be forced to further reduce clinic hours and cut patient services, ultimately leading to longer and longer wait times. Some physicians will close their offices and retire early or leave Canada. Patient accessibility of medical care in Canada already ranks third last amongst all of the wealthy countries (Commonwealth Fund). These tax changes will be further detrimental to Canada's already ailing health care system.

Patients and their physicians deserve and need access to timely and quality medical care in Canada. We all deserve fair taxes to help promote small businesses and ensure their survival.

We the Undersigned, concerned patients and doctors of Canada, urge Prime Minister Trudeau to preserve fair small business tax laws and not further erode access to our precious health care system.  Patients can never come first when frontlines doctors are put last.

Have you had to hold your pee, because using the assigned toilet makes you uncomfortable?

Unfortunately, a lot of trans* folks go through this on a daily basis. When I began working with the trans community in Assam, I found out that my washroom experience is replicated in every trans person’s experience. From being perceived as a threat, to being threatened, the washroom is a space of utmost discomfort for most trans* folks. This has resulted in a higher rate of dropouts in the transgender community.

Due to the binary division of toilets in institutions, trans* folks also face discrimination when asked to use a toilet based on the gender assigned at their birth. There have also been situations where we have had to hold our pee for the entire day due to avoid such undignified treatment. A gender-neutral toilet is not completely unheard of either. Recently Tezpur Central University initiated a gender-neutral washroom in the building of the Department of Social Work. Then why can’t we incorporate them in our educational spaces too?

This will not require a big shift in infrastructure but will require a shift in mindsets for sure. We need to sensitize the staff, faculty, and students in these spaces about gender and sexuality. When people understand the nuances of gender politics, they will better understand the predicament trans* folks face in using the toilet.

Di fronte a queste nuove morti con una confusa attribuzione delle responsabilità o accuse reciproche ci troviamo di fronte ad una ripetitiva e grottesca rappresentazione che non cambia la realtà di una situazione che si perpetua da oltre un decennio e che ha sepolto in quella tomba - che gli arabi chiamano Mar Bianco di Mezzo - decine di migliaia di persone.

Si tratta tuttavia di una minoranza di tutti coloro che hanno lasciato la vita e la speranza di una vita dignitosa nel deserto che separa l’Africa sub-sahariana dai paesi che si affacciano su quel mare, nelle carceri della Libia, nei campi di concentramento in Grecia, in Marocco e in Turchia e nelle impervie rotte terrestri della via dei Balcani.

A questo quadro drammatico si aggiunge ora la decisione della Commissione europea di fornire nuovi mezzi alla Guardia Costiera libica rafforzando così le sue capacità di riportare chi fugge dal terrore e dalle torture in un paese in cui sono noti i trattamenti disumani subiti dai migranti che provengono dall’Africa sub-sahariana.

Questa  decisione sarà per noi inaccettabile almeno fino a quando non sarà possibile creare in Libia dei centri - sotto il controllo dell’UNHCR e dell’OIM - per esaminare le richieste di asilo o l’inserimento in flussi legali o i rimpatri assistiti nei paesi di origine laddove saranno praticabili accordi bilaterali sostenendo nello stesso tempo il rappresentante delle Nazioni Unite nella promozione del processo di stabilizzazione assistito da un gruppo di contatto con una iniziativa del Consiglio di Sicurezza osteggiata dalla Russia.

Se i capi di Stato o di governo dell’Unione europea o i loro ministri degli interni chiamati a gestire operazioni di polizia studiassero la geografia che circonda il Mare Bianco di Mezzo si renderebbero conto della assurdità di una politica migratoria come è stata definita nel Consiglio europeo del 9 febbraio 2023 che si chiude e si limita:

- al controllo delle frontiere esterne,- ai respingimenti e alle riammissioni nei paesi di origine,- agli “ingenti investimenti” per creare delle infrastrutture di protezione,- agli ostacoli all’azione delle organizzazioni non governative,- all’ideologia del pull factor,- e al principio del paese di prima accoglienza.

Andando al d là dei principi della accoglienza e della ospitalità nel rispetto delle convenzioni internazionali, della Carta dei diritti fondamentali e della CEDU, si tratta di definire una nuova politica migratoria europea.

Essa deve coinvolgere nella misura del possibile i paesi di origine dei migranti e dei richiedenti asilo e facilitare il consenso delle opinioni pubbliche in particolare delle giovani generazioni contribuendo alla lotta contro le strumentalizzazioni e alle infondate paure ancestrali dei movimenti secolari di popolazioni.

Le istituzioni europee dovrebbero chiedere ad Eurostat un rapporto dettagliato

sui paesi di origine di chi emigra e di chi chiede asilo,- sui trend dello sviluppo demografico nei paesi in via di sviluppo ed in particolare nell’Africa sub-sahariana,- sulla crescita o meglio sulla decrescita demografica nei paesi dell’Unione europea e sui trend di invecchiamento delle nostre popolazioni,- sulle percentuali di cittadini di paesi terzi nei paesi dell’Unione europea suddivisi per regioni e anche fra aree urbane e aree agricole,- sulle aggregazioni di comunità etniche,- sui trend di matrimoni misti,- sui numeri della piccola e media imprenditoria insieme all’artigianato che fanno capo a cittadini non comunitari,- sugli equilibri di genere e generazionali.

Le istituzioni europee dovrebbero chiedete al Servizio Europeo per l’Azione Esterna un rapporto dettagliato

- sulle vere ragioni dei push factors legati ai conflitti interni e ai conflitti fra stati,- sullo stato delle desertificazioni nei paesi dell’Africa sub-sahariana,- sulle cause e sugli effetti delle espropriazioni delle terre,- sul livello di mancata realizzazione degli obiettivi dello sviluppo sostenibile 2030 in quei paesi ed in particolare “povertà e fame zero” (1-2), la “salute” (3), l’ “acqua pulita” (6), la “riduzione delle diseguaglianze” (10), la “lotta al cambiamento climatico” (13), la “pace” e la “giustizia” (16).

Sulla base di questi due rapporti e sapendo che i flussi migratori sono un fenomeno permanente mondiale e non solo continentale, le istituzioni europee dovrebbero a nostro avviso promuovere insieme alle Nazioni Unite, all’UNHCR e all’OIM entro la fine dell’anno e sotto presidenza spagnola una conferenza europea su una nuova strategia per le politiche migratorie che sia fondata sugli obiettivi dello sviluppo sostenibile e sul Patto mondiale per una migrazione sicura, ordinata e regolare.

Essa dovrebbe essere organizzata secondo il modello della democrazia partecipativa adottato dalla Conferenza sul futuro dell’Europa e dunque con la presenza attiva delle organizzazioni che lavorano nei paesi di origine partendo dall’impegno che il Patto mondiale sia adottato da tutti i paesi dell’Ue e quindi anche da Austria, Bulgaria, Croazia, Estonia, Italia, Lettonia, Lituania, Polonia, Repubblica Ceca e Ungheria che non parteciparono nel 2018 alla Conferenza di Marrakech e che si astennero o votarono contro il Patto Mondiale nella Assemblea delle Nazioni Unite del 19 dicembre 2018.

A conclusione della Conferenza dovrebbero essere a nostro avviso adottati

- una nuova Convenzione che sostituisca integralmente il Regolamento di Dublino,- un protocollo, da accludere al Trattato di Lisbona e in vista della sua più ampia revisione, che superi il capitolo 2 del titolo 5 del Trattato sul funzionamento dell’Unione europea sulle politiche relative ai controlli delle frontiere, all’asilo e all’immigrazione,- una proposta di bilancio rettificativo e suppletivo per creare uno strumento finanziario per il salvataggio in mare (European Sea Rescue o Mare Nostrum europeo) e per porre le basi di una Banca Euromediterranea per dare un impulso decisivo alla cooperazione economica dell’area e favorisca la cooperazione sub-regionale,- un mandato alla Commissione europea ed all’Alto Rappresentante dell’Unione europea per gli affari esteri e la politica di sicurezza di proporre al Consiglio e al Parlamento europeo un ampio piano di cooperazione allo sviluppo di tutto il continente africano per contribuire alla realizzazione degli obiettivi dello sviluppo sostenibile sulla base di un partenariato pubblico-privato,- un programma di educazione delle giovani generazioni che integri e rafforzi le politiche di accoglienza e di ospitalità.

ENGLISH VERSION



FOR A NEW EUROPEAN MIGRATION POLICY

The Mediterranean Sea claims even more victims. During the last weekend, a boat, or rather a dinghy, with 47 people – women, children, and men – tipped over into the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Passengers were at the mercy of a sea State 6. According to the icy calculation of the rescuers, seventeen people have been rescued, but thirty migrants are missing and may never be found.

These new deaths are the latest in a long list. It remains unclear who is to be held responsible. We are faced with a repetitive and grotesque performance. The situation has remained unchanged for over a decade, burying in that tomb—which the Arabs call the Middle White Sea—tens of thousands of people.

However, that number represents a fraction of all those who have given up their lives and hope for a dignified life, in the desert that separates sub-Saharan Africa from the countries bordering that sea, in the prisons of Libya, in the concentration camps in Greece, Morocco, and Turkey and in the impervious land routes of the Balkan route.

Furthermore, the European Commission decided to provide new means to the Libyan Coast Guard, thus strengthening its ability to bring back those fleeing terror and torture to a country where the inhuman treatment suffered by migrants from sub-Saharan Africa is well known.

This decision will be unacceptable for us until it will be possible to set up centers in Libya – under the control of UNHCR and IOM—to examine asylum applications or facilitate entry into legal flows or supervise assisted returns to countries of origin where bilateral agreements are feasible. In the meantime, it will be necessary to support the UN representative in promoting the stabilization process, assisted by a contact group with a Security Council initiative opposed by Russia.

If the Heads of State or Government of the European Union or their Ministers of the Interior called upon to manage police operations were to study the geography surrounding the Middle White Sea, they would realize the absurdity of a migration policy, as defined by the European Council of February 9, 2023, that is limited to:

- control of external borders, - refusals and readmissions in the countries of origin, - “huge investments” to create protection infrastructures on external borders, - obstacles to the action of non-governmental organizations, - the Ideology of the Pull Factor, - and on the principle of country of first reception.

A new European migration policy must be defined, going beyond the principles of reception and hospitality while respecting international conventions, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the ECHR.

It must involve as far as possible the countries of origin of migrants and asylum seekers and facilitate the consensus of public opinion particularly of the younger generation by helping to fight against the instrumentalization and unfounded ancestral fears of centuries-old movements of populations.

European Institutions should ask Eurostat for a detailed report:

- on the countries of origin of migrants and asylum seekers,- on population development trends in developing countries and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,- on population growth or, better yet, on demographic decline in the countries of the European Union and on our populations aging trends, - on the percentages of third-country nationals in the countries of the European Union broken down by region and by urban and agricultural areas, - on ethnic community aggregations, - on mixed marriage trends, - on the numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises and artisans which are made up of non-EU citizens, - gender and generational balance.

European Institutions should ask the European External Action Service for a detailed report:

- on the real reasons underlying push factors related to internal conflicts and conflicts between states,- on the state of desertification in sub-Saharan African countries, - on the causes and effects of land expropriations,- on the level of achievement of the sustainable development goals of 2030 in those countries and in particular “no poverty” and “zero hunger” (1-2), “good health” (3), “clean water” (6), “reduced inequalities” (10), “climate action” (13), “peace” and “justice” (16).

Based on these two reports, and keeping in mind that migratory flows are a world-wide phenomenon, we believe the European institutions should promote, together with the United Nations, UNHCR and IOM, by the end of the year and under the Spanish Presidency, a European conference on a new migration policy strategy based on the Sustainable Development Goals and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.

It should be organized according to the model of participatory democracy adopted by the Conference on the Future of Europe and thus with the active presence of organizations working in the countries of origin, on the basis of the commitment that the Global Compact will be signed by all EU countries and therefore also by Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which did not participate in the Marrakesh Conference in 2018 and abstained or voted against the Global Compact at the United Nations Assembly of 19 December 2018.

At the end of the conference, for us the following conclusions should be adopted:

- a new Convention to replace the Dublin Regulation in its entirety,- a protocol, to be annexed to the Lisbon Treaty and in view of its broader revision, to go beyond Chapter 2 of Title 5 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union on policies related to border controls, asylum, and immigration, - a proposal for an amending and supplementary budget to create a financial instrument for rescue at sea (European Sea Rescue or European Mare Nostrum) and to lay the foundations for a Euro-Mediterranean Bank to give a decisive boost to economic cooperation in the area and foster sub-regional cooperation’s,- a mandate to the European Commission and the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to submit to the European Council and the European Parliament a comprehensive plan for development cooperation for the entire African continent, to help achieve the goals of sustainable development based on a public-private partnership,- a program for the education of the younger generation that complements and strengthens reception and hospitality policies.

Officer Encinia took her mugshot while she was dead and staged her hanging in her cell, where she was found three days after being arrested. She was hung using a trash can liner that was tied to a hook on the ceiling.

It has been revealed that the Waller County Jail where Sandra was held failed to follow proper procedures. The FBI conducted an investigation and found that employees of the jail did not have required mental health training and there were no routine checks on inmates. A grand jury decided NOT to indite jail employees or the county sheriff. Officer Encinia was charged with perjury but those charges were dropped after he agreed to end his law enforcement career permanently.

Sandra was about to start a new job. She was happy. Her committing suicide simply doesn't make sense. This is clear misconduct on part of the Waller County Police Department.

This practice started the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, which already killed tens of thousands of people!



We ask the Government of the People's Republic of China to permanently ban in the country the sale and use of animals of various species living in the natural environment (wild animals) for medical and food purposes. This tradition was the reason for the horrible ongoing pandemic of coronavirus COVID-19 disease and the epidemic of atypical pneumonia caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV (Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus) in 2003.

According to scientists, the appearance of the human-infecting coronavirus COVID-19 could be caused by recombination of the bat virus and the pangolin or snake virus, which, among other wild animals, are sold in numerous markets in China [1,2]. The coronavirus COVID-19 could be introduced also by other wild animals, which are brought to the numerous markets of China from the whole world. The coronavirus can persist for a long time on various surfaces, including the fur of animals. Keeping animals in unsanitary conditions of Chinese markets, in close contact with each other, could also cause its quick spreading. Nobody knows what other dangerous diseases may come in the future for people because of this custom in China.

We believe that the Government of China has to permanently ban the sale and use of wild animals in the country for food and medicine purposes in order to prevent similar pandemics in the future!

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could be comparable to the world war in terms of its consequences for the economy and society. And this story is far from over. On April 7, 2020 1,444,822 cases of coronavirus infection COVID-19 have been confirmed in 209 countries and territories, including 83,103 fatalities. The increase over the past day was +13,903 cases and +1,069 fatalities [3]. The borders of almost all countries in the world have been closed. In some countries the passing between regions and cities is forbidden. The quarantine or isolation of people from each other has been introduced almost everywhere. Because of it, all people, adults and children, have lost the normal healthy style of their life for a long time. They cannot study, work and relax efficiently, many of them lost their jobs and single income. In some regions, people cannot even go outside their houses and must spend weeks inside their homes without fresh air and physical movements. The economy was damaged all over the world, the horrible consequences of which will be felt in the near future. No doubt, this is the worst crisis in recent decades, which can last for several months or even years.  All this happened only because of the Chinese custom to use wild animals for food and medicine!

The Chinese passion to use of various wild animals for cooking and medicine supports the poaching and “legal killing” of wild animals in China and many other countries. This caused the devastation of many wild natural lands. Tens of thousands of wild animals, including endangered species, are supplied to the Chinese markets every year! Saiga antelope, brown bears, tigers, leopards, musk deer, rhinos, elephants, pangolins, snakes, bats, and many other wild animals are killing for the nutritional needs of the Chinese. Now, this passion has led to the world apocalypse of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In order to prevent new pandemics of virus infections, the tradition of using wild animals for food and medicine has to be stopped in China.

Please sign this petition and turn on your voice to convince the government of China to permanently ban the purchase, sale and use of wild animals for food and medicine! It may help to prevent similar pandemics in the future.

With this pristine location comes the inevitable conflict between humans and wildlife. An adequately managed conservation program can reduce the number of these conflicts by educating the local community, enforcing legislation designed to protect people and animals alike and responding to conflicts in a timely manner.

The local national parks of Mt Revelstoke & Glacier are an example of where wildlife management programs comprising of research, collaring and tracking, review of movements and sightings, distributing and enforcing warnings for areas of high bear activity, closing problem areas as required alongside relocation and additional bear management strategies, can minimize the potential conflicts between people and bears to ensure everyone can coexist safely.

Revelstoke previously had conservation officers located in town, however after staff retirements, the decision was made and repeatedly confirmed, that Revelstoke would no longer have a local CO and would require response from officers located in Golden and Vernon.

Today, we hear of another bear killed in the downtown core of Revelstoke, at least the 2nd this season. This is a scene that cannot continue to be repeated. Not only is this poor management of the resources that abound in Revelstoke, but the tourists who come to Canada and Revelstoke to enjoy the outdoors, perhaps with the hope of viewing wildlife in it's natural surroundings, are caught up in the scene of a bear being killed the center of our city for lack of a better option. With the ever increasing number of tourists visiting the, these events will only increase in frequency.

In addition to bear management, a CO with time and a commitment to the greater Revelstoke area can also again enforce hunting and poaching legislation to ensure fair and appropriate hunting practices are followed nearby.

As the BC Minister of the Environment, we cordially request that you again consider the reintroduction of a Conservation Officer to Revelstoke or at the very least, explore other options to place trained wildlife management specialists, perhaps in partnership with other organizations nearby, within Revelstoke.

FERC conditioned that PacifiCorp, a company owned by Billionaire Warren Buffett, remained a co-licensee. PacifiCorp now says that FERC’s decision denies its customers the protections it negotiated, and they want to renegotiate, despite having already collected $200 million from their ratepayers and $250 million from California taxpayers for the purpose of dam removal. The Agreement already shields PacifiCorp from risks and liabilities associated with dam removal, making the Agreement already in PacifiCorp’s best financial interests.

Buffett’s PacifiCorp is threatening to back out of the dam removal agreement. This goes back on two decades of negotiations and betrays the trust of their partners, who include many Tribal nations and Klamath River communities. Threatening to walk out on Klamath River and coastal communities is not the behavior of a socially responsible company. It’s time for PacifiCorp to recommit to dam removal.

With every year that passes, Klamath River salmon edge closer to extinction. We can’t afford any more delays in this process. It’s time for Warren Buffett’s PacifiCorp to do the right thing and allow this dam removal agreement to move forward.

SIGN THIS PETITION TO SUPPORT THE MOST AMBITIOUS SALMON RESTORATION PROJECT IN THE WORLD AND TELL WARREN BUFFETT TO RECOMMIT TO DAM REMOVAL!

Background

Most experts view dam removal as the lynchpin for solving the water crisis that plagues the drought-prone Klamath Basin almost every year. Shallow, stagnant reservoirs breed toxic algae and decimate water quality, pushing Klamath River salmon to the brink of extinction. Decades worth of spawning gravel has accumulated behind the dams, preventing proper habitat conditions downstream, and anadromous species that historically migrated to the upper basin have lost access to over 420 miles of spawning grounds and habitat. Upriver Tribes like the Klamath Tribes of Oregon have not had access to salmon in over 100 years. A lack of salmon and clean water directly contributes to ongoing health issues in the region, including high rates of diabetes and heart disease. Dwindling salmon populations make it so that fishermen and communities cannot subsist from salmon fisheries, contributing to poverty and a loss of livelihood in Oregon and California.

The dams provide no irrigation diversions, no drinking water diversions, and no significant flood control benefit. California and Oregon have already approved dam removal permits. The money to remove the dams has already been raised by ratepayers and taxpayers. On July 29th 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom sent a letter to Warren Buffet, urging Berkshire Hathaway and its subsidiary, PacifiCorp, to move forward with dam removal. Financially, dam removal is cheaper than retrofitting improvements in the form of fish ladders. Relicensing the dams is risky and expensive- managing the aging structures today costs more than they’re worth.

A fire can expose firefighters to millions of chemicals and toxins. We have become aware of the massive risks these toxins pose for first responders, who breathe them in, ingest them, and absorb them through the skin while putting their lives on the line. Most states have adopted “cancer presumptive laws,” meaning that if a firefighter gets cancer on the job, they are automatically awarded accidental disability to see them through their illness. The increased rate of Parkinson’s Disease (PD), a degenerative brain disorder, in firefighters has emerged.

I am a firefighter who was recently diagnosed with Parkinson’s. I am not alone -- while the rate of PD in the general population is 3 out of 1000, it is 30 out of 1000 for firefighters. I am young to be experiencing this disease, but that’s often how it works for emergency responders, and there is mounting evidence that our exposure to toxins is the culprit.

Four firefighters who all fought a tire fire in Spencer MA in 1986 have all been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.

My state of Massachusetts has great presumptive laws for firefighters, not only for cancer, but for heart and lung disease as well. It is now time for our legislators to include Parkinson’s Disease among these illnesses. There is no disputing the connection between toxic chemical exposure and PD anymore.

While PD usually develops slowly among the general population, symptoms often hit firefighters fast, seemingly out of nowhere. Research now suggests that toxin-induced PD has a more rapid onset than genetic PD, another indicator that we are, indeed, contracting this illness on the job. For those of us struggling with Parkinson’s, walking, talking, grasping and even blinking become increasingly difficult tasks to accomplish. Needless to say, continuing to work as firefighters while battling this disease is most often not possible.

Indiana recently became the first state to include Parkinson’s in its presumptive law. This has provided unimaginable relief to many firefighters, who were running out of sick time, and facing unemployment and massive medical bills due to their debilitating disease. We now must band together and demand that more states recognize the link between firefighting and PD, and include PD among the illnesses covered by their presumptive laws.

Please sign this petition to include Parkinson's in Massachusetts’ presumptive law, which would allow firefighters with Parkinson's to retire on full accidental disability.

There are several factors that affect the livelihoods of Black trans women: denial of healthcare, rejection from loved ones, homelessness, survival sex work, the list goes on. Though seemingly unrelated, the perpetuation of these denials of personhood only further to put trans women of color in danger.

In a privatized healthcare system like here in the United States, healthcare is not exactly seen a human right, but rather a privilege. Even then, just this past month that privilege became restricted to transgender individuals after the Affordable Care Act was overturned to explicitly remove the prohibition of gender identity discrimination, arguing it was to protect religious freedom which in turn could reaffirm the Trump Administrations use of religious freedom to codify discrimination. When setting this kind of example at the federal level, it sets the precedent that trans people are not people to be respected or listened to. Denial of healthcare is just the first step in the othering of transgender people. It’s a dangerous slippery slope that opens the floodgates for more heinous acts of violence towards an already disadvantaged group of people.

In 2018, seventeen Black transgender women were reportedly killed; there are still a couple months left in the year and we have already surpassed last year’s count. One in ten trans people are attacked every year. Half of the transgender population are survivors of sexual assault. Black trans women are more likely to be fired due to their gender identity, 1 in 4 in comparison to the 1 in 6 non-Black trans people. They are also three times more likely to be unemployed than the rest of the United States population. Long story short, Black trans women have the short end of every stick and through illuminating White and/or cisgender people on the issues they do not normally face we can all fight for better treatment and protections for Black transgender women.

Black transgender women are of most disenfranchised groups of people in the United States. This campaign has been created to spread awareness to the people who may not face the disadvantages that the intersection of Black and transgender and feminine do face day to day."

The pandemic has reduced or in some cases rendered the formal and informal justice and support systems that were in place for DV survivors, non-functional. This is apart from the fact that 86% of women who face domestic violence in India do not seek help.

During COVID-19, not only was access to legal support missing for survivors, there was limited access to emergency housing and shelter services.

While Domestic Violence (DV) is not unique to the pandemic, there is increasing evidence and consensus that the lockdown ordered to deal with the pandemic has aggravated cases of DV in India. One Future Collective runs a FemJustice Helpline that provides legal, mental health and social support to survivors of sexual and gender based violence. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic we got 3x the calls we would get earlier. More and more people that called us needed interim housing or shelter before they could seek support from a friend or family member. The National Commission for Women also stated that the number of domestic violence survivors seeking help increased 2x during the pandemic.

The needs are immediate and building new infrastructure will take time. The time that this will take will be detrimental to the health and safety of women and queer folks forced to live in abusive households. We need every stakeholder to step up and take action to enhance the safety and wellbeing of survivors of domestic violence, including women and LGBTQIA+ folks.

Airbnb has provided similar support in the USA (Chicago) and Ireland and is attempting to do this in Mexico. Airbnb has not only understood the severity of the issue but it already has the expertise to provide such support to survivors. Airbnb’s unique model gives it a presence in neighbourhoods across India. It is in light of this information that we’re making these demands of Airbnb:

1. Provide free emergency housing for survivors of domestic violence;2. Develop a platform or system through which survivors can access such housing easily and without the prerequisite of an FIR or police complaint; and3. Train your stay partners on protocol for trauma informed communication and support for survivors that may access such housing.

I think the more important question to ask is, why shouldn’t girls have the right to go to school?

My courageous friend, sixteen year-old Muzoon from Syria, goes from tent to tent in her refugee camp in Jordan encouraging girls to stay in school. My sister Amina from the North of Nigeria, where Boko Haram threatens girls for simply wanting to learn, mentors younger girls who continue to want to go to school.

There are over 60 million of our sisters around the world who share a thirst for education, yet do not have the opportunity to go to school or who have to drop out too soon. Together we can change that.

In September, world leaders will commit to 12 years of free, safe, quality primary and secondary education for every girl and every boy in the new United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This commitment holds tremendous promise for my sisters demanding more for their lives. But a commitment only counts if a commitment is kept. The Global Partnership for Education (GPE) must lead the way in upholding this commitment, just as it has led way in supporting 9 years of education for millions of children to date.

The GPE is a major funder of education in some of the world’s poorest countries. It makes possible incredible work to help students all over the world, every day. When countries give money in foreign aid for education lots of it goes to the GPE, and in December its Board of Directors will determine how that money will be used by over 60 nations around the world.

But currently the GPE’s focus is on funding 9 years of free, quality education for girls in these countries. We are asking that the GPE Board vote to expand its focus to a full 12 years of primary and secondary education and that GPE partners step up and give more money so that girls are given the opportunity to complete secondary schooling. A change like this will have a dramatic effect on the lives of millions of girls around the world who will be able to go on to become the leaders, teachers, scientists that they want to be and that our world needs.

I am blessed everyday to wake up and know that I can receive a free, quality primary and secondary education, but I shouldn’t be the exception. Now is the time for us to join our voices and make a change for our sisters around the world.

Stand with us and ask the GPE and its partners to lead the way on 12 years of primary and secondary schooling for girls through committing to mobilise the money necessary to achieve it.

Our survival is quite honestly a miracle. We are indebted to the mighty range that is protecting us: the Aravallis. Like a great-great-great grandparent, India’s oldest mountain range has nourished us and taken care of us.

Aravallis in South Haryana are the lungs of the National Capital Region, supplying ground water for the survival of millions of people, protecting us from air pollution and the dust storms coming from the Thar. It is now time for us to protect and nourish the Aravallis. Not just for you and me but for our future generations.

Sadly, our collective actions are destroying them. So it is only our collective actions that can save them. We are a group of citizens from the National Capital Region who have been fighting tooth and nail to save the Aravallis, as it is our very lifeline but we cannot do this alone. This majestic range needs planned government intervention to survive and thrive.

On 1st November 2021 (which is Haryana Day) we have started this petition asking the Chief Minister of Haryana, Mr. Manohar Lal Khattar to adopt the 8 points we have listed out and truly be a government that takes climate change seriously.

1) Increase forest cover in Haryana from a measly 3.6% to the national average of 20%.

2) Identify all forests in the state including all Aravallis according to the dictionary meaning of forests as directed by the honourable Supreme Court.

3) Stop illegal mining and cancel plans to legalise mining in the Aravallis.

4) Remove all illegal encroachments in the Aravallis.

5) Renew 80% of the expired notifications under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) and withdraw the PLPA Amendment Bill that seeks to open up 33% of the area treated as forest land in Haryana for real estate.

6) Retain all Aravallis in the Natural Conservation Zone.

7) Declare all Aravalli areas in Haryana such as the sacred forest of Manger, Damdama lake etc that are part of the corridor for the movement of wildlife from Asola wildlife sanctuary in Delhi to Sariska in Rajasthan as a wildlife sanctuary to protect the rich wildlife thriving here.

8) Remove the toxic Bandhwari landfill and cancel plan for the Waste-to-Energy plant in the eco-sensitive Aravalli belt.

As Citizens, we have a few suggestions that can help the government take concrete actions:

a) Increase forest check posts, patrolling and surveillance of the Aravallis using drone technology to stop illegal forest activities.

b) Set up a help-line number for people in villages and cities to report instances of illegal tree felling, mining and encroachments on forest land.

c) All remaining Aravalli areas (50,000 acres plus) including biodiversity and wildlife rich areas like the sacred forest of Manger, Gurgaon’s Aravali Biodiversity Park etc. that have not been notified as deemed forests under the Punjab Land Preservation Act should be brought under the protection of forest and wildlife laws.

d) Retain all areas recorded as Gair Mumkin Pahad, Bhood etc in the revenue records as legal Aravalli areas and not exclude them from the Natural Conservation Zone as these are critical areas for ground water recharge.

e) Preserve the beauty of the Aravalli ecosystem by creating healing forests as done by countries like Korea, Japan etc and have the villagers create livelihoods by being trekking guides and running home stays in the Aravalli belt..

f) Withdraw the clearance given for a 15 MW capacity waste to energy plant at Bandhwari landfill site. No further clearance for a 25 MW WTE capacity plant to be given.

g) Eliminate 35 lakh plus tons of legacy waste at Bandhwari landfill by implementing proven, tried and tested techniques like Bioremediation and do native planting to reclaim 30+ acres of Aravalli land.

h) Scrap the 22 year old contract with the inefficient firm Eco Green. Integrate waste pickers and waste workers to replace Eco Green in Gurgaon and Faridabad.

i) Stop the daily dumping of 2000 tons of unsegregated, mixed waste from Gurgaon and Faridabad at Bandhwari landfill by strictly enforcing Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 based on source segregation and decentralised waste management in both the cities.

We received the Aravallis from our ancestors who cared for it.  We need to pass it down, still alive, still protecting, still nourishing us and other life forms. Sign and share this petition widely so that more people join our cause to demand our right to breathe clean air and have water security. This will give us a greater chance of being heard by the government. Let’s save the Aravallis for our today and our children’s tomorrow.

I request you to kindly sign this petition and join me in our quest to save OUR home. Let’s not make this political. Let your emotions be the first priority and think lovingly for the home we abide in, it needs our help.

This petition isn’t against the authorities , it is to ask for help regarding the severe water problem our country is about to face in the next 5 years and it can become irreversible soon. It is to tell them that a lot of us are interested in Cooperating together and find solutions for daily lives and get alert and acknowledged on a bigger scale. We thought that doing are part is enough but current situations don’t seem to work on that basis.

Many people asked us, “are you trying to become an activist?” We want to ask these people, do you have to be an activist to help the home you live in ? This little effort isn’t for just you and I but for a better society as we will pass but the coming generations will face terrible challenges.  And honestly this is for each and everyone. You are just helping yourself.

Possible Outcome :

So we have just filed this petition in the hope of having a number of people sign up for this cause, we are planning to write a letter to the authorities, requesting them to at least start planning solutions which can be feasible for the public. To let them know that people are wanting help regarding the water conservation and it can only be done on a bigger and practically effective scale when they help us, as they have the resources to make it happen.

WE still are trying to figure out and learn more regarding such petitions and solutions to connect people. WE need you, to give us ideas, solutions and hope that things can change for the good and better. We know this is just another petition on the list of a million but at least we can try with a smaller group, maybe it works. Do consider.

Thank you

La première fois qu’une femme a porté plainte contre lui, celle-ci est morte avant d’être entendue par la police. Abandon de la procédure. La deuxième fois qu’une femme a porté plainte contre lui, il a été jugé au tribunal correctionnel et relaxé. La troisième fois qu'une femme a porté plainte contre lui, c’était sa conjointe. Classement sans suite.

4 femmes différentes ont porté plainte contre ce monsieur. Et les 3 premières fois, la justice n’a pas fait son travail. Elle aurait pu l’empêcher de violer à nouveau. Le condamner, l’obliger à suivre un dispositif de soin pour sortir de la violence.

Non. La justice n’a pas manifestement pas voulu voir. « Monsieur, continuez, aucun problème.

Madame Belloubet, vous êtes ministre de la Justice. Vous êtes la garante que cette justice fonctionne en France. Formez les magistrats, de manière obligatoire, pour qu’ils comprennent les violences, les condamnent et ne laissent pas les violeurs violer à nouveau.

Le viol ne peut rester impuni."

On 3 April 2021 we took her to Perth Children's Hospital because she was running a temperature. A few hours later she had passed away. She was seven years old. The reasons for her passing are varied but the chief among them is a systemic failure of the WA Health processes. An external inquiry is examining the issues that led to her death.

Since Aishwarya's death we have been inundated with other cases of similar neglect and poor service that have resulted in further damage to our children. However, we, as a family, are looking to change the WA Health system. To do this we call on the WA Premier to undertake the following actions:

* The resignation of the Health Minister Roger Cook

* The resignation of All Medical Professionals involved in the event on April 3rd 2021 involving Aishwarya.

*The resignation of Dr Aresh Anwar, the CEO of the Children and Adolescents Health Services

*Changes to the health system that modify the existing practices to be more cognisant of parental concerns

*Systemic changes to all aspects of patient care to be more inclusive

J'ai 22 années d'expérience professionnelle, en qualité d'assistante de direction, administrative et commerciale.
22 ans que je travaille depuis l'âge de 16 ans, 22 ans que je me suis appliquée à gravir mes petits échelons, à me faire reconnaitre et appréciée de par mon travail.
3 CDI : motifs de fin de ces CDI : deux pour licenciement économique, et le dernier, suite à la naissance et LE diagnostic posé sur un de mes jumeaux, j'ai dû y mettre fin, car les prises en charge n'étaient évidemment pas compatibles avec mon poste ""bien évidemment"", et surtout pas d'aménagement possible...
Bref, entre ces CDI, des missions intérim, des CDD.
A l'issu de mon dernier emploi, bénéficiant de l'ACCRE, prime versée aux créateurs d'auto-entreprises qui correspond à 50% du capital allocation chômage, j'ai créé début 2010 deux activités, une boutique en ligne d'articles bio pour bébé et enfants, dont, je reversai une partie de mes ventes (maigres ventes) à la Recherche pour la maladie de mon enfant, dont j'ai arrêté l'activité depuis juillet 2012, mais transformé cette boutique en blog, dont, si le coeur vous en dit, vous pouvez y jeter un coup d'oeil ici : La Cabane de Margo où je poursuis mon combat pour aider la Recherche.  Aussi, j'en profite, puisque malgré tout, j'aide la recherche sur le syndrome de mon enfant, je confectionne des bracelets dont les ventes sont intégralement envoyées à la Recherche. Autre petite parenthèse, et pas des moindres, ces bracelets sont réalisés en coton, j'ai, depuis mi-février 2013, obtenu aussi le soutien et l'aide de Phildar, qui me fourni gratuitement les fils....rien que ça, et moi toute seule, comme une grande.Donc, en parallèle de cette boutique devenu blog, j'avais également créé une activité d'assistanat virtuel, où je proposais divers services de saisies, de créations de sites web sous Prestashop, de la transcription audio, je, on va dire, ""travaillotais"". Beaucoup de missions de transcriptions audio, de saisies, mais, pour avoir des missions, j'avais dû mettre des tarifs très attractifs, c'était, oui, presque du bénévolat, mais ce besoin de me rendre utile autrement, de m'évader de la maladie était, et, est toujours viscéralement nécessaire. Si bien que, le régime d'auto-entrepreneur est parfait, mais le temps passant, j'allais être rattrapée vite fait bien fait par certaines taxes qui sont pendant les 2 premières années exonérées, donc bon, je ne travaillais pas suffisamment pour pouvoir m'""offrir"" un tel luxe.
Et donc, me revoilà, sur le marché du travail, demandeur d'emploi active...très, très active...
En juillet 2012, je mets donc un terme à mes 2 activités, et je viens gonfler les chiffres du chômage.
Travailler oui, ça je le veux, mais quand ??? avoir un enfant dit différent, nécessite une prise en charge, donc des rdv, être là les mercredi et vacances scolaires, parce que bon....inutile d'espérer que votre enfant soit accueilli en périscolaire, l'école le veut bien et parce qu'il y a une loi datant de février 2005,  ils se sentent un peu obligés, mais ailleurs, faut pas exagérer non plus quand même !
Alors, force de constater, que je vais devoir travailler de nuit, et oui ! et je dors quand ? ben, ça tout le monde s'en fout ! par contre, faut être au top, ""ménagez vous"" nous dit on, ""faites attention à vous"" etc.... et d'encaisser les petites allocations, qui sont là soit disant pour compenser ta perte de travail, et qui représentent ""généreusement"" et très difficilement le tiers de ce que je gagnai. Alors certes, je ne suis pas une adepte de l'assistanat, désolée ce n'est pas dans mes gènes, assister : oui, mais être assisté : NON !
Bref, donc, avant que je ferme définitivement mes activités indépendantes, je regardais quotidiennement les offres d'emploi de nuit, et ce qu'il y avait et qui ressortait régulièrement de nuit, c'était des offres de cariste, de préparateur de commande, mais pour cela, il faut au minimum le CACES 1 voire 3 et 5 c'est encore mieux. Ni une, ni deux, enfin....si, quand même, je m'y reprends à plusieurs fois, avant de me dire, que, ben, je vais passer ces 3 CACES, vous savez, c'est le permis pour pouvoir être apte à ""piloter"" des chariots élévateurs. Grosse, grosse remise en question, mais bon, pas le temps de s'en poser de trop, je m'offre ce permis, soit plus de 800€....aïe ! ça fait mal, très mal ! Le CACES 1, 3 et 5 en poche, je postule, m'inscris dans des agences interim, pour oui, revenir à des salaires très bas, genre SMIC, table rase sur un beau parcours professionnel qui faisait ma fierté personnelle, d'avoir commencé en tant qu'apprentie, d'avoir passé le BEP Communication Administration et Secrétariat en candidate libre, et de l'avoir obtenu haut la main, de n'avoir eu en 22 ans de carrière qu'une toute petite période de chômage. Donc, retour à la case départ, et donc là, les agences d'intérim me disent que quand même il faut de l'expérience....octobre 2012 arrive et là, Bingo ! une agence veut bien de moi en tant que novice, pour les fêtes de noël pour travailler de nuit les week-end dans une grosse, grosse entreprise de vente en ligne, dont je ne citerai pas le nom, pas besoin d'en faire de la pub, personne n'en fait pour moi, mais qui se trouve à plus de 50 kms de chez moi tout de même... Donc, ok pour travailler malheureusement seulement les we, de 16h à 3h du matin et de faire du ""picking"" c'est un pad qui nous indique les commandes à récupérer et flasher les produits, et grosse, grosse cadence demandée en ces fêtes de fin d'année. Fatiguant, certes, mais quelle joie de se sortir de cette vie si peu joyeuse, de voir du monde, de parler autre chose, que rdv psychomot, orthophoniste, kiné.....j'en passe et pas des meilleurs.
Les fêtes de fin d'année ont passées, et les missions de nuit, ont fondues comme neige au soleil, disparues, plus rien ! Bon, voilà, j'ai les CACES, c'est bien, j'en fais quoi maintenant ?
Dans mes recherches d'emploi, ce que je constate aussi de nuit, c'est, le métier d'auxiliaire de vie sociale, il y en a plein. Rebelote ; je me renseigne, et là, bien, il faut un diplôme, donc par conséquent, suivre une formation....encore là, le serpent qui se mord la queue, une formation ? je fais comment ? je me tourne, avec l'accord de mon conseiller pôle emploi, vers les formations à distance, et là, rien, si ce n'est des formations pour pouvoir accéder à des concours d'entrée en école, en tant que maman lambda, j'aimerai pouvoir suivre ces formations, mais je ne suis pas une maman lambda, je ne peux pas aller à l'école, j'ai là, mon enfant qui attend de moi, d'être là, avec lui à la maison quand LUI est là...
J'ai même écrit à la Présidence de la République, pour penser un peu à nous, parents exclus de la société à cause de dame nature, nous n'avons rien fait, si ce n'est vouloir donner la vie, pas être condamné  à ne plus retravailler, nous en avons besoin, tant sur le plan financier que moral.

L'heure est à l'action.

Fermeture de France Ô : un mépris pour les outre-mer et la culture

La Journée internationale du souvenir de la traite négrière et de son abolition est commémorée le 23 août de chaque année. Cette Journée vise à inscrire la tragédie de la Traite dans la mémoire de tous les peuples. C'est cette date, ce jour, que le Ministère de la Culture a choisi pour fermer France Ô.  Un symbole fort du mépris envers les Ultramarins.

Entre la suppression des congés bonifiés, l’empoisonnement de la population ultramarine par la chlordécone, le scandale de l'eau non potable, les sargasses, la continuité territoriale qui n'est pas assurée, et aujourd’hui la suppression de France Ô qui est le SEUL lien entre l’hexagone et les territoires et départements d’outre-mer.

Vous êtes plus de 100 000 à avoir signé notre pétition. Aujourd'hui, nous vous demandons de nous rejoindre pour dire non au mépris affiché envers les outre-mer.

Rendez-Vous dimanche 23 Août à 14 H 30 Place du Palais Royal !

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pour rappel, ci-dessous , historique de la pétition :

----------------------------------------------------------

Bonjour, je suis Zamor Glenroy, auteur compositeur et interprète originaire de la Guadeloupe et de la Dominique. J’ai entendu, comme bon nombre d’entre vous, que le gouvernement voulait supprimer France Ô !

Je m’insurge contre cette décision injuste et méprisante à l’égard des originaires d’outre-mer mais aussi de tous les amoureux des outre-mer. Nous avons besoin de France Ô sur la TNT .

On nous parle de passage sur le net mais personnellement beaucoup de membres de ma famille ne vont jamais sur le net. Ils n’ont que la télévision pour rester en lien avec les Dom-Tom à des milliers de kilomètres !

C’est injuste aussi pour les artistes. Pour nous, les nombreux artistes ultramarins, c'est compliqué de faire entendre et découvrir nos musiques car aucune chaine ne nous donne notre chance, À PART FRANCE Ô qui soutient et encourage nos talents DE FAÇON INDÉFECTIBLE.

Alors aidons les artistes, nos familles, nos parents à conserver la chaine gratuite du groupe France télévisions, France Ô. Ne nous privons pas de ce service publique, ne nous laissons pas être oubliés.

Signez la pétition pour montrer que nous sommes nombreux . Merci.""

LA PÉTITION

La réforme de l’audiovisuel public est engagée et le sort de France Ô est suspendu aux résultats d’une consultation des concitoyen-ne-s des Outre-mer et de leurs élu-e-s. Le destin de la chaîne des Outre-Mer est désormais entre les mains de madame la Ministre de la Culture.

Comment mettre au mieux en valeur les programmes et la vie des Outre-mer, et au-delà la dimension ultramarine de la communauté nationale, dans l’offre du service public ?  Du résultat de cette question mise en ligne sur le site du ministère de la culture semble dépendre l’avenir de France Ô.

Aussi, sans attendre le résultat de cette consultation, nous, spectatrices et spectateurs de France Ô, avons décidé de lancer cette pétition pour montrer tout notre attachement à cette chaîne.

France Ô est un pont entre l’hexagone et les territoires d’outre-mer.

Sa suppression serait une atteinte à la mission essentielle du service public : la continuité territoriale : assurer la visibilité dans l’hexagone des réalités des Outre-mer. Ce serait un écran noir apposé sur l’existence de tous les originaires des Outre-Mer.

Pourquoi cette chaine devrait-elle disparaître ? Rappelons la promesse de notre président de la république Emmanuel Macron qui, en avril 2017 alors qu'il était candidat aux présidentielles, déclarait que France Ô ne serait pas supprimé et que son programme avait une justification pleine et entière

Peut-on se satisfaire d’un : « Au revoir, merci ! » ? NON !

Les programmes de France Ô sont certes perfectibles mais ils sont une fenêtre ouverte sur tout un pan de notre culture.

Quelle autre chaîne met en avant les originaires d’Outre-mer ?

Nul besoin de rappeler que France Ô a permis de valoriser le travail d’entrepreneurs, d’artistes, de créateurs, de talents français originaires des Outre-mer.

Que l’on soit originaire d’Outre-Mer ou tout simplement amoureux de ses cultures , nous ne pouvons que réagir face à la menace de suppression de France Ô.

Nous avons besoin de faire entendre nos voix. En signant cette pétition, vous montrez votre engagement pour soutenir et faire en sorte que France Ô ne disparaisse pas du canal hertzien.

Si vous vous sentez concernés, solidaires, attristés, révoltés ?

Lorraine is a woman with three teenage children who is facing imminent eviction from her private-rented home due to the sale of the house by the landlord. Her eldest child suffers from severe autism and OCD. Her younger children are settled in education here in Nottingham, on courses that can’t be transferred. She has trawled through the list of private rented accommodation but there is nothing suitable. She does not want to put them through the same stressful experience a year down the line. Her family need secure accommodation.

SOCIAL HOUSING FOR LORRAINE!Nottingham City Council have proposed emergency hostel accommodation, but this would be totally unsuitable for her disabled son’s needs. His social worker has put in a firm recommendation that the family needs permanent social housing, not temporary accommodation. It has also been suggested that Lorraine should move out of Nottingham: Sheffield, Derby, Birmingham and Stoke have all ben mentioned. We find this totally unacceptable. Lorraine and her family have a human right to a private and family life. Her children have a right to education and social life. Her disabled son has a right to stable living environment and support services that he is accessing in Nottingham.

SOCIAL HOUSING FOR ALL!With cuts to housing benefits, rising rents, rising levels of overcrowding and rising homelessness and more, Nottingham is facing a housing crisis. So many people need homes, and yet there are empty houses and long council waiting lists. The solution is straightforward: SOCIAL HOUSING FOR ALL!

300,Child Q: Demanding #Justice4ChildQ & Protection of Black Girls,searches of children without the consent of their parents or guardians. This will help protect the privacy,"['Sadiq Khan', 'Nadhim Zahawi']",Vinna Best,"london, ENG, United Kingdom",72927,"Mar 17, 2022",https://assets.change.org/photos/9/vk/vg/vyVkvgpYPQunHdj-800x450-noPad.jpg?1675530720,"My name is Vinna from Dear Black Women and Girls CIC. I am concerned because Black girls are still facing reality where they are not recognised as children who deserve protection, but rather as adults and criminals who need to be punished. It is imperative to acknowledge that Black girls matter and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.Trigger warning

No Safe Haven: Anti-Black Racism, Misogynoir, Police Brutality and School ViolenceOn March 14th, 2022, a Local Child Safeguarding Practice Review was made public detailing the horrifying experience of a Black British school girl. The 15-year-old student, known as Child Q (to protect her identity), experienced harm at the hands of Metropolitan Police officers and teachers at a school in Hackney, London in December 2020.

Child Q was mistakenly accused of having drugs. As a result, an intrusive and humiliating search which involved her having to spread her legs and removing her sanitary pad while menstruating was carried out.

This demeaning breach of Child Q’s rights and invasion of her body autonomy highlights the failure of professionals who were supposed to keep her safe, not cause harm. This traumatic experience has led Child Q to seek therapy and self harm. What happened to Child Q was due to adultification and misogynoir biases, the result of anti-Black racism.

It is imperative that all professionals are held accountable for their actions.

What Happened? The Humiliation of Child QTeachers at Child Q’s school wrongly accused her of having cannabis. They called the police, who then arrived and conducted a strip search of the student without adult supervision. This was extremely traumatising and embarrassing for Child Q, as not only was she striped searched but made to expose intimate parts of her body while menstruating and was not even allowed to use the toilet.

Child Q’s parents were not present or told of the strip search and did not give consent for it to take place. Also, the Safer Schools Officer was not told beforehand, and no appropriate adult was present during the search, including no teachers, parents, or representatives from social services.

No drugs were found on Child Q during the strip search or when the room she was waiting in was searched.

Regardless of whether drugs were found or not during the strip search, the manner in which Child Q was treated was unacceptable and a clear violation of her basic human rights and dignity.

Adultification: Black Children Deserve to be Treated as Children TooAdultification is the perception and treatment of Black children as if they are adults. Preconceived notions and biases lead to negative stereotypes, discriminatory expectations, and the characterisation of Black children as being “adult-like” and “less innocent” compared to their peers. The issue of adultification bias in schools is a huge concern.

This biased treatment causes significant harm to their academic and mental wellbeing, leading to a higher likelihood of disciplinary actions and negative outcomes beyond the classroom.

Adultification bias in schools and police need to be addressed and eliminated to create a more equitable and supportive learning environment for all students.

Misogynoir in the School SystemThe systemic discrimination faced by Black British girls in education is a disturbing reality that demands immediate attention.

What happened to Child Q highlights the intersectional nature of this discrimination, as her experiences were shaped not only by her race but also her gender.

The persistent and harmful stereotypes of Black girls as “strong” and “angry” contribute to a societal belief that Black girls require less protection and nurturing, leading to unequal treatment and harsher punishments in comparison to their peers.

Data obtained through a freedom of information request by Agenda, an alliance of over 50 charities advocating for excluded women and girls, showed that Black British girls face a significantly higher risk of being excluded from school, with rates twice those of White British girls during the 2019-2020 academic year.

This highlights the need for action to address the systemic discrimination faced by Black British girls in education.

Child Q’s Voice: Sharing the Experience of the Inappropriate School SearchThe public review sheds light on the views and feelings of Child Q:

“Someone walked into the school, where I was supposed to feel safe, took me away from the people who were supposed to protect me and stripped me naked, while on my period.

“…On the top of preparing for the most important exams of my life. I can’t go a single day without wanting to scream, shout, cry or just give up.”

“I don’t know if I’m going to feel normal again. I don’t know how long it will take to repair my box. But I do know this can’t happen to anyone, ever again.” “All the people that allowed this to happen need to be held responsible. I was held responsible for a smell.”

“…… I need to know that the people who have done this to me can’t do it to anyone else ever again. In fact so NO ONE else can do this to any other child in their care.”

“Things need to change with all organisations involved. Even I can see that.”

Mother’s Views on the School’s Failure to NotifyChild Q confided in her mother about the distressing incident, which led her mother to take her to the family doctor for a referral for mental health support. This led to the involvement of Hackney Children and Families Services (Hackney CFS). The public review includes the following views of Child Q’s:

“(Professionals) treated her as an adult. (She was) searched as an adult.”

“…the incident that happened (was) treated not as a safeguarding issue. (It was) treated as a criminal matter.”

Call for Justice and Recommendations:

Dismissal of responsible parties: Take appropriate disciplinary action against teachers and police officers who caused harm to Child Q.

Impartial review of the police conduct: Supplement the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation with an impartial review to ensure an unbiased and thorough investigation of the Child Q incident.

Accountability for schools and police: Establish clear expectations and accountability measures for schools and police to ensure they are taking proactive steps to address and eliminate the biases that caused Child Q to be harmed.

Intersectional education for teachers and police: Training and professional development to raise awareness about adultification, gendered racism, and misogynoir.

Create safe and brave spaces: Encourage schools to create safe and brave spaces for students to discuss and address their experiences with these biases. This can be done through student groups, counselling services, or other support systems.

Address biased policies: Review school policies and procedures to identify and eliminate policies and practices that perpetuate these biases.

Schools and the police need to better engage with community partners: Collaborate with community organisations and advocates to address these biases and create solutions. This will ensure that the perspectives and experiences of affected students and families are included in decision making.

Ensure legal protections: Ensure that laws are in place to prevent strip searches and other forms of intrusive searches of children without the consent of their parents or guardians. This will help protect the privacy and dignity of students and ensure their rights are respected.

Encourage diversity and inclusion: Foster a school culture that bertter values and celebrates diversity and inclusion. This will help to counter the negative effects of adultification, gendered racism, and misogynoir and create a more supportive and equitable learning environment."

Workers paid to support people with disabilities have not seen a wage increase since 2014 (despite an increase in the cost of living of 14% over the past eight years). They are feeling stressed and undervalued and many are choosing to leave their jobs for other employment where they will be properly compensated for their skills and valuable contributions.

The low wages and retention rates are of serious concern to community-based employers who are struggling to recruit and retain qualified staff to provide essential services to Albertans with disabilities.

Immediate action is required by the government of Alberta.

Community Disability Service Workers must be properly compensated for the essential work and the value that they bring to the lives of Albertans with disabilities and their families. Failure to provide an influx of new dollars to raise the wages of this workforce will result in an escalating crisis across the province.

Le 30 septembre 2015, au Mexique, Justine Puissesseau était tuée par un chauffard qui roulait dans un 4X4 non homologué, à vive allure, en grillant un stop et au téléphone. Aujourd’hui cet homme est libre au Mexique ! Aidez-nous à faire exécuter le mandat d’arrêt  international qui a été délivré par l’Espagne. Aidez-nous pour que le ressortissant espagnol soit jugé dans son pays d’origine.

Tuée sur le coup, Justine avait 31 ans et une petite fille de 21 mois, Kiara. Justine était française, le chauffard, touriste, est de nationalité espagnole, le drame s’est produit au Mexique, à Playa Del Carmen.

Depuis 6 ans, nous nous battons, notre famille et des proches, pour obtenir un procès. Pour obtenir justice, mais surtout la vérité pour sa petite fille Kiara. Depuis 6 ans, cet enfant grandit sans sa maman. Devra-t-elle grandir sans savoir pourquoi on lui a enlevé sa mère ?

Nous avons suivi toutes les procédures judiciaires en France et en Espagne. L’Espagne a délivré un mandat d’arrêt international en octobre 2019 contre le chauffard car son procès est prêt à Madrid depuis plus 3 ans. Et pourtant, le Mexique ne fait rien. Il s’oppose à l’extradition du chauffard. Il bloque toute coopération avec l’Espagne ou avec la France. Alors même, de l’aveu des autorités mexicaines, une partie de la procédure de police a été « perdue » et doivent recommencer leur procédure….

Le Mexique est un Etat souverain, nul ne le conteste. Mais la justice est universelle : nous avons le droit à ce que le meurtrier de notre fille, sœur, mère soit jugé.

Puisque les procédures judiciaires n’aboutissent plus, il ne nous reste que l’opinion publique : aidez-nous à faire pression sur les autorités Mexicaines. Aidez-nous à faire exécuter le mandat d’arrêt qui a été délivré. Aidez-nous à ce que cette personne soit jugée dans son pays d’origine, l’Espagne.

JUSTICE FOR JUSTINEDenial of justice in Mexico: Help us get a fair trial On September 30, 2015, Justine Puissesseau was killed in Mexico by a reckless driver in an unlicensed SUV who ran a stop sign while on his cell phone.  After killing Justine, he fled the scene. Today this man is free. Help us bring the killer to trial in his country of origin. Killed on the spot, Justine was 31 years old and had a 21-month-old daughter, Kiara. Justine was French.  The driver, a tourist, is of Spanish nationality.  The tragedy occurred in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. For 6 years, Justine’s friends and family have been fighting for a fair trial.   We want nothing more than justice and, above all, the truth for her infant daughter Kiara. For the past 6 years, this child has been growing up without her mother. Will she have to grow up without knowing why her mother was taken from her? We have followed all the legal procedures in France and Spain. Spain has been ready to try the killer in Madrid for over 3 years, but Mexico refuses to allow that to happen. It refuses to extradite the hit-and-run driver.  It refuses to cooperate meaningfully with Spain or France. Instead, the legal process remains in Mexico, according to the Mexican authorities, a part of the police file has been ""lost"" and, 6 years later, the criminal procedure must begin again on this incomplete file .... Mexico is a sovereign state, no one disputes it. But justice is universal: everyone has the right to have the killer of our daughter, sister, mother tried. Because the legal process offers no meaninful relief, we are left with public opinion: help us to put pressure on the Mexican authorities. Help us to bring the killer to justice in his country of origin, Spain. Signing this petition is a way of applying pressure. Your support means so much for our crusade for justice for Justine.

JUSTICIA PARA JUSTINE

Denegación de Justicia : Ayúdanos a obtener un verdadero proceso.

El 30 de septiembre del 2015, en Mexico. Justine Puissesseau fue colicionada y a su vez asesinada por un conductor de un jeep 4x4 modificado ilegalmente, a toda velocidad, el cual no respetó un señalamiento de ALTO TOTAL y además hablaba por teléfono. Hoy este hombre está libre en México ! Ayúdanos a ejecutar la orden de detención internacional emitida por España. ayúdanos a garantizar que este ciudadano español sea juzgado en su país de origen.

Muerta al instante, Justine tenía 31 años y una pequeña bebe de 21 meses de nombre Kiara. Justine era de nacionalidad Francesa y el conductor asesino del jeep de nacionalidad Española, el asesinato ocurrió en la ciudad de Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo.

Desde hace 6 años toda la familia y amigos cercanos, continuamos luchando para obtener un verdadero proceso. Con el objetivo de obtener justicia y principalmente la verdad para su pequeña hija Kiara. Desde hace 6 años y por el resto de su vida, Kiara no puede continuar su crecimiento sin saber porque el asesino de su madre sigue libre y disfrutando de una vida normal, cabe mencionar que Kiara no guarda en su pequeña mente, ningún recuerdo de su mamá.

Nosotros hemos seguido muy de cerca todos los procesos judiciales en Francia, España y Mexico. El gobierno Español emitió una orden de captura internacional en octubre del 2019 contra el conductor asesino ya que un juicio penal lo espera en Madrid desde hace casi 3 años.

Mexico no ha hecho nada, Mexico se opone a la extradición del conductor asesino. Se ha dedicado a bloquear toda cooperación con los gobiernos de Francia y España. Aun así, según admiten las propias autoridades mexicanas, parte del procedimiento policial se ha perdido y tienen que volver a iniciar su procedimiento. México es un Estado soberano, nadie lo discute. Pero la justicia es universal: tenemos derecho a que se juzgue al asesino de nuestra hija, hermana y madre.

Como los procedimientos judiciales ya no tienen éxito, nuestra última opción es pedirle a usted y a la opinión pública su ayuda. : Ayúdanos para hacer presión en la conciencia de las autoridades Mexicanas. Ayúdenos a hacer cumplir la orden de arresto que se ha emitido. Ayúdanos a que esta persona sea juzgada en su país de origen, España. Firmar esta petición es una forma de presionar. Es un apoyo que nos dará, que puede tener mucho peso para conseguir justicia para Justine.

This month alone we have lost four collegiate athletes from suicide. As NCAA student-athletes, we have been doing our part to combat the stigma surrounding mental health in athletics through organizations like Morgan’s Message, the Hidden Opponent, and various other mental health initiatives at our respective institutions. However, we can see that despite our work across the country, mental illness remains a pressing issue in collegiate athletics.

It is time for intervention and time for change in the culture of collegiate athletics.

As a four-year, NCAA Division 1 student-athlete, I can speak firsthand on the lack of support and the suffocating stigma that exists in the athletic community surrounding mental health. From my freshman year on, I developed severe depression and anxiety, and struggled in silence until my junior year; only feeling able to seek help because I was off campus and out of season due to the pandemic. However, just because we, the student-athletes who seek help, have made a remarkable step, does not necessarily mean life gets any easier. Returning to campus, all of that work you have done to better yourself like starting therapy or medication is not to be discussed. Personally, I was terrified to tell my teammates and my coaching staff, thinking that I would be viewed as weak, and not the same leader and teammate they had relied on before. I did eventually tell my team and staff about what I was experiencing. However, this was because I was also telling them that I had to take a leave of absence from the team and school due to the severity of my depression and anxiety, after I had a panic attack in front of all of them while warming up before a game.

It shouldn’t have to come to that. The culture of collegiate athletics promotes student-athletes to suffer in silence. The NCAA fosters an environment that prioritizes athletic and academic achievement above all else, and many times that is at this expense of our physical and mental health.

The following are three necessary adjustments to your position on mental health to make a difference in collegiate athletics:

Mandate a Mental Health Practitioner at Every University: In your study from 2016, you recommended that a mental health practitioner should be, “easily accessible to student-athletes, which includes being accessible through establishment of a self-referral process.” A recommendation unfortunately will not do much. Many athletic programs outside of the Power Five have limited funding. Priority is not given to mental health, unless their students are crying out for one; and from first-hand experience, simply that does not guarantee a hire...let alone a timely hire. Many athletes cannot seek the mental health services necessary due to social stigma as well as the time constraints of playing a sport in college. Having an on-site resource is vital in easing what can be a daunting step to most athletes seeking help. We would never be without athletic trainers, so how are universities still without a mental health practitioner?

Subsidize Mental Health Practitioner Salaries at Eligible Institutions: A majority of Division 1 universities rely on subsidies for their athletic budget. As stated previously, hiring a resident mental health practitioner tends to fall lower on the priority list for administrators. As revenue returns to normal and student-athlete suicides prevail, the NCAA should not only mandate every university to hire a mental health practitioner that has not already but support the salaries for those institutions that are struggling financially.

Increased Education Programs for Staff and Coaches: We as mental health advocates are grateful for the recent research on mental health published by the NCAA and the Innovations in Research and Practice Grant Program. However, at minimum, we need annual mandatory training sessions on mental health for college-athletic staff and coaches. Coaches are spending at least 20 hours a week with their student-athletes during debatably the most crucial time in their human development. It is critical that these individuals are educated properly on the signs and symptoms of mental illness, the damaging effects, and how to properly discuss mental health with their athletes.

Student-athletes are begging for your help, and investment in our well-being, as we dedicate ourselves to our university and our sport every single day.

We cannot lose another life.

Save people from harmful packaged food: Print Warning On Unhealthy Food Products

To reduce the impact of unhealthy food products on health, the Food and Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has initiated the model of Front of Packing Label (FOPL) of packaged food products. FSSAI has decided issue a draft regulation to include ‘Health Star Rating' (HSR). Food product will get a half to 5 Stars depending on its contents.

We believe that this is being done under pressure from the ultra-processed food industry, who earlier opposed a traffic light label and now happy with Stars.

Minutes of the meeting show that FSSAI has chosen to ignore public health and consumer interest by giving undue importance to the opinion of large food processing industries.

Scientific evidence favours that unhealthy foods be given a Warning Label, which has demonstrated to reduce consumption of unhealthy food products. Warning labels are quick to understand and impact on consumption.

Link: https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003015

Realizing the importance of this issue, many countries have introduced mandatory warning labels including Chile, Peru, Israel, Mexico, Uruguay, and soon to be introduced in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Venezuela.

The Scientific evidence does not support Health Stars on food products.

Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jhn.12758

Scientists believe that these ultra-processed foods are causing many non communicable diseases ( NCDs) including cancer.

Link: https://www.napiindia.in/docs/Concept-Note-for-regulating-UPF.pdf

We have been eating healthy and nutritious foods, real and unprocessed, our diet has always been very balanced. But in the recent past, the trend of ultra-processed foods has increased and especially markets are flooded with ultra-processed foods and these are aggressively marketed affecting the health of both children and adults.

Link https://www.ijsr.net/archive/v5i9/ART20161741.pdf

It’s notable that companies use excessive amounts of sugar, salt (sodium) and saturated fats to entice customers and make children get addicted to these products. In our country, diabetes, blood pressure, kidney and liver diseases are becoming common due to excess  of sugar, salt/sodium and saturated fats in the food.

People lack such awareness and unknowingly consuming these harmful food items. Therefore it is the responsibility of the government to tell people which food products are safe to eat and which are not.  If such a warning is posted on foods products having excess of sugar, salt or saturated fats beyond a WHO’s prescribed threshold limit, consumers will be able to learn and make informed decisions about their food purchase and consumption.

Today, when the country's food regulatory body is taking a decision in this regard, the health of the people of the country should be the first priority and not the profit of the companies.

Therefore, we the people of India, consuming the food products available in our market, would like you to :

1. Ask FSSAI, to make decisions without the involvement of food industry or its front groups.2. Ensure that packaged food products have warning labels expressing nutrients of concern if they are in excess to be harmful."

307,"Justice pour Fluker, baleine vivante, mais déchiquetée !","Madame la Ministre,
Lors d’une sortie d’exploration des cétacés en Mer Méditerranée en octobre 2019 à bord du bateau « Santo Sospir » de l’association Sos Grand Bleu St. Jean Cap Ferrat un rorqual commun a été observé au large de Cannes avec la nageoire Caudal déchiquetée.Les chances de survie avec une telle amputation sont minces.
Ce signalement du 5 octobre fait écho à celui du 14 septembre fait par un pêcheur dans la même zone. Pour l’heure, les causes de ces lésions ne sont pas précisément connues mais d’après les blessures observées il s’agirait du résultat d’une collision.
Cette année, le jeudi 25 Juin ce rorqual est de nouveau sur nos cotes, dans un état cadaverique et tous les scientifiques s'accordent à dire que ""Fluker"" va mourir aprés 15 ans de lutte aprés sa premiere collision. Dans cet etat physique il est impossible pour lui de sonder et de plonger pour se nourrir.
Chaque année, une quarantaine de grands cétacés décèderaient des suites d’une collision avec un navire en Méditerranée.
Ce rorqual a été observé au cœur du Sanctuaire Pélagos, ce sanctuaire qui voit chaque jour passer des bateaux de transports de passagers ou de marchandises (ferry, cargo, tanker, porte-conteneurs, etc.), dont la taille dépasse souvent les 100 mètres, et qui naviguent entre 14 et plus de 40 nœuds. Ils suivent une route précise, parfois invariable tout au long de l'année, alors que le nombre de rotation peut varier : il augmente notablement durant les mois d'été pour les transports de passagers entre les îles de Méditerranée (Corse, Sardaigne) et le continent.
Avec un trafic maritime annuel estimé annuellement à 220 000 navires marchands, la navigation commerciale est particulièrement intense en Méditerranée occidentale. Le Sanctuaire Pelagos et ses frontières n'y échappe donc pas, avec 2 des 8 « nœuds de concentration du trafic maritime » (Gênes et Marseille) identifiés dans tout le bassin et une trentaine de liaisons par jour assurées par au moins 8 compagnies de transport de passagers entre le continent, la Corse et la Sardaigne.
Vous n’êtes Bien entendu pas sans savoir qu’il existe un système efficace « REPCET » permettant aux navires équipés de s'informer en temps réel de la présence de cétacés dans une zone à risque.
Malgré le faible coût en comparaison des frais des compagnies maritimes, le montant de l'abonnement REPCET reste le principal argument avancé par les compagnies qui ne souhaitent pas s'équiper. Une minorité des bateaux faisant route en Méditerranée aujourd’hui en sont équipés.
En effet, La plus grande hérésie qui soit vient de la loi biodiversité de 2016 qui oblige l’installation du système REPCET pour tous les navires commerciaux de plus de 24 mètres battant pavillon français.
En 2019, 36 navires sont équipés du système REPCET, ce qui correspond à 0,04% du trafic maritime.
C’est presque un déni de se dire qu’on l’oblige au Pavillon Français quand on sait que personne (ou presque) ne bat Pavillon Français non ?
Pour les autres navires l'équipement  dépend uniquement de la volonté de ses dirigeants de s'engager dans cette démarche environnementale.
Le montant de l'abonnement varie de 300 à 350 euros par mois et par navire. Ces coûts ne servant qu’a couvrir les frais de fonctionnement du système. A titre de comparaison, les frais d'entretien d'un ferry s'élèvent à 50 000 euros par jour.
En plus de cet aspect écologique, les collisions posent un problème de sécurité dans le cas des navires rapides. Un choc avec une baleine à 30 ou 40 nœuds peut causer l'ouverture de brèches sur les coques des navires, et une voie d'eau est alors possible. C'est ce qui s'est passé à plusieurs reprises sur les routes de liaisons avec les îles ces dernières années. Sans compter les problèmes sanitaires, de respect d'horaires, de coûts de réparation et d'image auxquels la compagnie maritime concernée doit faire face en cas de collision.
Madame la Ministre , ne serait t’il pas possible, dans un premier temps, d’imaginer de légiférer pour que 100% des bateaux passant au sein des routes maritimes du sanctuaire Pélagos soit obligatoirement équipées d’un système de localisation des cétacés ?
Dans l’idéal vous devriez légiférer pour qu'aucun navire de commerce ne passe dans le sanctuaire des Pelagos, ce passage est antinomique d'un endroit destiné à préserver la tranquillité des animaux marins.

According to the Middle Eastern UK, Germany, Russia, Canada, among several others.

As one would expect, these voices thrive in adverse situations such as war, humanitarian crises, unregulated ownership of guns and other weapons, and lack of legislation and political commitment to protect women. All of this culminates in the senseless killing of thousands of women, who lose their lives on daily basis in the name of honour. This umbrella term, honour crime, is often used by man-killers to justify assaulting and killing any woman, be it a sister, a daughter, a wife, or a cousin. Even a distant relative's life is out for grabs by any man who belongs to the same family or tribe - a right that has always been supported by the ancient patriarchal ideology that still prevails in our society. It is this patriarchal mind that says honour can only be defended by spilling the blood of a woman - any woman for that matter.

It has to be stressed that killing a woman because of her gender is not an a rare or a one-off scenario. On the contrary, it represents a global societal problem, based on the stereotypical dichotomy of human genders, where men are traditionally viewed as holistic and godly rulers over their female counterparts. This issue is particularly prevalent in MENA (Middle East and North Africa), a conglomerate of Arabic speaking countries where religious and tribal authorities merge to a singular paternal autocracy. Only in MENA do people publicize and take pride in tribal killings and honour crimes, as one can see on unadulterated social media posts.

In 2021, the world was shook by the vicious, premeditated, and video-taped murder of ""Aida al-Saidou,"" the young Syrian girl who lost her life in the name of defending tribal honour. The killers were none other than the men in her own family, who not only took away the young girl's life, but also blatantly video-taped and documented their murder. A murder that has been blessed by society and its regulations, by tribe and its pride in protecting murderous men. The same men who send misogynistic messages advocating killing any woman who dares step out of her pre-determined familial role -messages that guarantee the persistence of the ancient patriarchal institution with its outdated sexist ad-hoc regulations.

With the beginning of 2022, the reported number of murder cases that target women has been on the rise in Syria, Egypt, Iran, and Iraq, reaching an all-time high. The practice of ""punishing"" a woman who has ""desecrated"" family's honour is on the rise, as reflected in the reports of various International human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International, as well as in various media reports and eye-witness testimonies. According to reports, the areas most affected by these practices include, in addition to the above, Kurdish areas, the West bank, Gaza strip, and Jordan. These areas are regarded by women's right activists as the worst anti-feminist areas in modern history. However, there are other countries where the reported crime numbers are wildly under-estimated, thanks to media censorship and government covering. A prime example is Egypt, where official sources deny the mere existence of women killing in the name of honour.

According to the Middle Eastern quarterly report, honour crimes are more prevalent in countries with majority of Muslims, which together constitute 72% of all cases worldwide. With the exploding refugee situation, refugee families from affected countries export their flawed ideas to the countries that welcomed them in. It is therefore understood how the culture of killing in the name of honour is being exported to countries like the UK, Germany, Russia, Canada, among several others.

It is reported that there are 20,000 women who are killed annually by male members of their families or tribes. Most of these killings occur in Islamic countries such as Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and Iraq. Dozens of these crimes are registered as suicide cases, while hundreds of other crimes are covered by burying the girl in desert, followed by claiming that the victim was married or has travelled abroad. In many cases, a stray bullet from a male family member finds its way to a girl's chest, who is then buried in an unmarked grave in the middle of nowhere.

Following the above we, as women's rights ogranisations, standalone feminist activists in Arabic speaking regions, as well as nonbinary gender-neutral people, we all disapprove, condemn, and refuse these stereotyped crimes. We therefore request international human rights organisations to do the following:"

Pet owners moving away & relocating in different homes, with not a worry in the world, leaving these helpless animals to suffer behind to roam lose & starve, meanwhile the owners could care less, people that move away and abandon, should be charged with animal cruelty & punished for their absolute immoral actions to the fullest extent of the law, putting a law into effect! A punishment / fine of $500 per abandoned animal! If we don't stand up for these animals who will, when will this STOP!!! IT'S A NEVER ENDING BATTLE! Chaining dogs to fences or yards is cruelty to an animal! Dogs & Cats should never be chained, making these animals feel helpless & terrified, they have no access to food, water or shelter, for God's sake they deserve to live happy & loved, chaining only makes them feel lonely & hopeless! A law in order to legalize a punishment / fine of $500, per animal!

Neglecting pets is another issue! People neglect pets on a daily basis! They neglect vet care, immunizations, rabie shots, they leave pets to roam the streets without adequate protection from danger on busy streets and highways! Dogs & cats are found in every corner deceased, due to being hit & killed in an instance! Dogs & cats being shot & tortured because of neglect! Why should a dog have to search for food and water daily to survive,  while owners decide to live happy lives and go on about their busy lives! Why should people be allowed to have pets without proper fencing or any fencing for that matter! The truth is people don't give a damn! They are heartless and cruel, so I think its only fair to punish/ fine of $500 per animal that people are caught owning  with no vaccinations, that are not registered through the county properly, each dog must be registered to Lubbock county as proper ownership of animals to be able to identify where the neglect of animals start! Do you think it's fair to find a roaming dog, searching for survival, hungry & starving, sick without any vaccinations, only to find its been shot or killed by a car, because you didn't have a fence & were to busy to care for that animal to begin with! In reality this dog, this cat, never had a chance of life!

Dog fighting, abuse and starvation is a huge problem in Lubbock county, we have to do better as a community to help these animals at risk! Dog baiting for dog fighting is nothing more than heartless, disgusting people out there! To see a dog scared that has managed to escape, full of fear, wanting love and affection, yet they won't come close for rescue because they are afraid for their lives or just throwing in dogs & cats as dog bait to teach them how to fight and kill! Just the thought of a puppy or kitten, being shredded to pieces, being devoured & killed for a thrill, is disgusting & sickening! Starvation of dogs, so they can shred & devour an innocent animal in seconds because they are so hungry! Dog fighting, teaching dogs to attack & kill their very own species! Dogs attacking each other, in dog fighting rings, placing bets on dogs to earn grotesque money, abusing the dogs or even killing them after losing a fight, beating them until their very breath & will to be happy is taken from them! Being burned, barely alive or shot, because that dog just cost the owner $200 measly dollars! That is of coarse if the losing dog survives! The chances of being killed in a dog fight, imagine how much pain that dog just went through, piece by piece of it's flesh being torn out & chewed up! And the owners get a fabulous thrill & laugh of what dog was so sadly killed, talking about,  see you next week,  same time! A punishment/ fine of $5,000 per dog abused & killsd per proof of ownership, registering the dog, through Lubbock County would confirm ownership, on top of dog fighting punishment for a full year of incarceration! Per dog ownership! It's time to crack down these heartless people that have created the problem to begin with!

Recycling & backyard breeders should be punished/ fine of $500 per dog! Pet owners must have their pets SPADE OR NEUTERED ! As a pet owner dog must be registered through Lubbock county to stop the very problem of creating more animals to danger & death! Is the money more important than the life of an awesome animal that only wanted love & affection and in return their loyalty and trust!

Dumping dogs in county roads, parks, fields should be punished/ fine $500 per animal that people/person get caught dumping! Dogs are not disposable trash, they are supposed to be man's best friend,  they should have the chance of graceful & loving living! Dumping dogs to find them dead on the side of the road, corner or picked up for animal bait! Registering animals creates an opportunity for Lubbock county & starts an end to all the animal madness that happens daily!

I petition to create a Law, that will stop animal cruelty once and for all! To punish & fine every unfit pet owner to the fullest upmost extent of the law that is found guilty of charges!

Please join me in signing a petition to save every single animal we can, together we fight until justice is in order and done! Animal rights within Lubbock, Tx ( Lubbock county) if we petition together our county, our community and our animals will be safer, better & honored! Help me fight this war against animal cruelty that people have created & some how forgotten their morals and responsibilities towards helpless frightened dogs, cats ( animals) That a Law be created to protect every animal out there on every corner, every field, every diet road!

Lubbock County , Lubbock, Tx, respectfully we ask that you please help us create a law that will be successful in saving animal lives & successfully stop the very over populated County we so dearly love! We stand United against abuse, abandonment, neglect, starvation, recycling, dumping & dog fighting!

Thank you, I hope to create a law that will end this never ending story! A law that will successfully help Lubbock county in the future! God bless!

I am 19 years old and I live in a small town named Hanford, California. I moved on my own to Hanford in November of 2018. I was a Starbucks barista for about a year and five months. When I was offered the job at Starbucks, I was so ecstatic and couldn’t wait to start. Starbucks is known for its inclusiveness to the LGBTQIA+ community and, recently, a strong ally for the Black Lives Matter movement. Being a member of both, I was excited to enter a safe space and meet new people in a new town. Being a barista is a very difficult, fast-paced job. I am a very fast learner and quickly moved up to our bar position, where we make all the drinks. Bar is a position you have to work towards, and getting there within your first three months usually never happens. I worked very hard to get to bar. I would work 6, even 7 days a week so I could get comfortable on bar and improve my skills. I had occasional issues with two of my shift supervisors. There would be days where I would be belittled, demeaned, watched and harassed by those two shifts to see how much I could handle. When I tried to become a barista trainer, it all got much worse. Their excuse being, “well, if you want to be a trainer, you’re going to have to deal with it.”  I was written up twice for cash register shortages. The first write-up, on October 29, 2019 was because my cash drawer was 25$ OVER the amount it was supposed to be. Even though it didn’t make sense to me at the time, I signed the written warning and went back to work. Soon after, on November 22, 2019, I received my second write-up. This write-up stated that my register was short just the day before. I explained to my store manager that I was mainly on bar that day, making drinks. I only went over to drive-thru for a total of 20 minutes, to cover two of my coworkers’ 10-minute breaks. During that time, I had only taken cash payments maybe once or twice. Most people paid with their credit cards or Starbucks cards. The main person who was on drive-thru that night, who no longer works for the company, had a history of problems with our cash registers. He would constantly get confused with change, refunds, special offers, etc. At most Starbucks locations, and especially at our store, the same cash register is used all day. It is counted once in the morning and once at night. There is no concrete way of knowing who was on the register when the money went missing. Since they needed someone to blame, and I already had a previous write-up, I was forced to sign the final written warning. From that point forward, I nearly refused to be on drive-thru. I wanted to avoid any further misunderstandings. I have been on my own and providing for myself for a few years. I needed this job and I was getting a lot of hours on the schedule. I had to move around a lot and never had a stable living environment; I didn’t want my work environment to be unstable too.

Around late April-early May 2020, our team welcomed a new partner. He was a transfer from another district, and I was excited to make him feel welcome in our store, especially during this global pandemic. Then, on May 31st, after working with him for a few weeks, Ian Cloyd comes in for his scheduled shift and sees me and my shift supervisor, another black woman, in the back of house. I was washing dishes while my shift supervisor was on her break. We weren't having a discussion at the time Ian walked in. He sees both of us, minding our own business, when he proceeds to ask, ""oh my gosh guys. have you heard about the protests? haha crazy right?"" (please keep in mind that Ian is a CAUCASIAN MALE). I decide not to engage in conversation with him, especially since I wasn't certain on his stance towards the BLM movement. My shift supervisor, however, entertained him by engaging in conversation. My supervisor gets off her break and the conversation between her and Ian is brought to the front of house. I hear that their conversation is still going after about five minutes, which is when I decided to change the conversation from today's protests, while still keeping the topic of racial discrimination. I turn towards my shift supervisor and another black coworker and ask, ""when was the first time you two realized racism was a thing when you were younger?"" All three of us go on to share our experiences with each other, while everyone else listened and educated themselves. Then, out of nowhere, Ian says, very loud, with the drive thru window open, ""THEY USED TO CALL ME N***ER LIPS IN SCHOOL!""  We all froze in shock and silence. Ian apparently thought no one heard him, so he repeated himself, this time much louder. Loud enough for my shift supervisor to hear from the bar area. She says, ""what did you just say?"" Ian then repeats himself. That's three times. Three times this derogatory slur was used by a Caucasian male on the Starbucks floor. The supervisor then sternly said, ""do not say that on my floor, ever! that makes me extremely uncomfortable as a black woman."" Not once did Ian apologize to me. Not once was any remorse ever shown for his actions on the floor that day. He simply remained quiet until he felt like it was ""okay"" for him to ""joke around"" again before the end of his shift. After he left, all of us, especially myself and my black coworkers, were in absolute shock, confusion, anger, and disappointment. I wanted to be the one to speak up. I had to be. I worked at this Starbucks longer than both of the other black woman who worked there. All of my coworkers agreed that this word should have never been used at work, by anyone, whatsoever. I really believed that my voice was going to be heard. I hoped that action would be taken to prove that Starbucks was actually against the fight of racial injustice. Unfortunately, I was let down. Ian got nothing but a mere sit-down discussion with our store manager, Kathryn McCoy. No investigation, no serious consequences whatsoever. It was simply swept under the rug. Much like all the other cases of racism, discrimination, harassment and COVID-19 safety violations that constantly occur in every Starbucks in not only California, but in the world. For example, two other stores in our town had someone test positive for COVID-19 in early July. Instead of closing the store for mandatory cleaning and disinfecting, they were open to the public with shorter operating hours. Baristas from our store and surrounding stores were scheduled to work for the people at the stores who got sick or exposed, in an infected store. Some baristas didn’t hear about the news until they were already working at the store, which caused a lot of anger and anxiety for them.  When I talked to my store manager about it initially, a few days after the incident with Ian happened, she seemed extremely upset. She seemed determined to seek justice for me and my coworkers. She even said, “I know I don’t have the same struggles as you, but I am going to use my privilege to make sure this doesn’t get swept under the rug.” Long after her conversation with Ian about his language and behavior, I heard nothing about the situation. No updates, no requests for further information, nothing. It was like nothing happened. It took over two weeks and two shift supervisors talking to my store manager for her to touch base with me again, and she sounded completely different from the first time we talked about the situation. It seemed like an inconvenience to her. She said that Ian was going to stay as a barista no matter what, and wanted to find ways for me to ""DEAL WITH IT."" She suggested that a tiny sit-down discussion would make me get over his derogatory remarks. I told her that one discussion was not going to fix the problem and that I felt extremely uncomfortable working with him. I even opened up to her about how it was hard for me to sleep at night knowing that I had to wake up in the morning and work alongside him. She got defensive when I told her that, from my perspective, it seemed like nothing was done about the situation. She snapped and told me to try and ""come up"" with anything else Ian had done in the past week to warrant any disciplinary action. As if saying a derogatory slur three times wasn’t enough. The conversation concluded with her apologizing for sweeping this issue under the rug and admitting that she didn’t do enough. She said, after working for Starbucks for 16 years, that this was her “first time” dealing with someone saying a derogatory slur and thought her and the district manager could handle it on their own. My heart fell into my stomach. After over a year of being completely devoted to Starbucks, my voice felt completely unheard.  On July 18th, I had to work with Ian. I was cleaning our bar area during a huge midday rush. I went to grab our syrups when one of them fell on the floor due to the pump not being completely screwed on. Syrup spills everywhere. I am in the back getting the mop when, out of frustration about the syrup, I yell ""f*ck"". Most of my coworkers either didn't hear me or didn't care, but Ian did. Ian wanted retaliation for my report about his use of derogatory slurs on the job. In order to ""get back"" at me, he reported me for my use of a curse word, in the back of the store. Starbucks believed that the f-word was a more fire-able offense than the use of a derogatory slur. This was the grounds for termination from my employment at Starbucks Corporation. To my knowledge, the store manager who fired me, Kathryn McCoy, and her district manager, Donald Wallis, never contacted HR about the situation regarding my racist coworker. They insisted the problem could be solved by the two of them alone. I always respected Donald and Kathryn and trusted their word, up until this point. I am creating this petition to put an end to the racism, discrimination, harassment and mistreatment that affects Starbucks’ from all across America. Back in 2018, Starbucks closed 8,000+ stores for sensitivity training regarding racial bias. It's time for a refresher course. Silence is deadly, and I will not hold my tongue for this company any longer. I am usually one who doesn’t like conflict or asking for help, but in a time like this, I need all the love and support I can get.  Until Ian is terminated and the management team is held responsible and reprimanded, Starbucks should not be known as a “third-place.” A Starbucks that allows racism is not inclusive. A corporation that supports derogatory remarks is not a place to spend your hard-earned money.  SIGN THIS PETITION AND HELP ME CONTACT HR TO TAKE ACTION AND SPREAD THE WORD THAT STARBUCKS IS NOT THE ALLY THEY CLAIM TO BE!!!! HUMAN RESOURCES:  Legal or Ethics (24/7): (800) 611-7792  https://businessconduct.eawebline.com        Starbucks Store #5873 on 550 W Lacey Blvd in Hanford, CA   Store Manager: Kathryn McCoy  District Manager: Donald Wallis  Regional Director Manager: Gina Hurstak"

Backstory

Ex-Nfl Quarterback, Colin Kaepernick has recently announced the release date of his new book ""ABOLITION FOR THE PEOPLE: THE MOVEMENT FOR A FUTURE WITHOUT POLICING & PRISONS"" on 10/12/21.

Unfortunately, the art cover created by artist and Ex-Black Panther Emory Douglas, displays a Dark Skinned Black Woman promoting ""Abolish the Police and Close the Prisons"". This art is harmful to the image of particularly Dark Skinned Black Women who are often promoted in the media as loud, undesired, aggressive, masculine, combative, and promotes the false agenda that Dark Skinned Black Women are an oppositional force to law enforcement. This will contribute to more instances of us being the recipients of rampant wounding misogynoir.  We are already a marginalized, unprotected, and ignored group who have the highest rates of intraracial related domestic violence, and this art cover going mainstream will further contribute to our mistreatment in society.

Art is so very powerful to promote desired portrayals. As stated on twitter by Dark Skinned Gentlewoman, Jim Crow art pieces were often utilized to dehumanize black people, and perpetuate racial propaganda that resulted in many black people being depicted as lazy, uneducated, and worthless caricatures who were undeserving of a quality of life as whites were. Black people fought to get these images removed from media because the racist depictions stripped them of their dignity, humanity, and in some cases their lives. This art and others that displays Dark Skinned Black Girls and Women as Social Justice Martyrs willing to prioritize fighting systemic issues over prioritizing our safety and well being, can have the same harmful effects to our imagery longterm.

SOLUTION: I am requesting that Colin and artist Emory Douglas , will change the book cover to either a Biracial Man whom resembles Colin's image, or a Black Man as they state they are most affected by the policing system and should be the face of fighting said entities.

Our hair is not a revolutionary act. Our skin is not a political statement. And our fuller features are not a think piece. Darker Skinned Black Women deserve to be represented in positive lights that highlight our womanhood, femininity, and confidence. Please stop using the most overworked, underserved, recipients of misogynoir and colorism, to be the face of your movements at the expense of our image and safety. Thank you.

The $111.bn Arts Sector is not just being left behind, it’s being actively ignored. We are an industry of over 600,000 professional artists and workers and the vast majority of us are freelance or casual and will be ineligible for Job Keeper in spite of the fact that most of us have been working fulltime in the industry for years. We have failed to rate a mention in any of media interviews or online polls and statistics concerning employment compensation, yet our industry hasn’t just slowed it has vanished.

There seems to be a misconception that the Arts consists of celebrities, those on “big bucks”, famous people who live in mansions and own yachts. But we are an industry of workers. For every name you know there are thousands behind the scenes slogging it out to bring you the shows, music, theatre that you know and love. Take a moment one time to actually watch the whole credits on a film and see how many names are there, ALL of those people are being left behind. ALL of those people are falling through the cracks.

People in the Arts aren’t on big bucks. We work hard. Most of us live pay check to pay check, not feast, just short of famine. Professionals in the Arts have multiple jobs, we have projects lined up one after the other for as far in advance as we are able to book, often picking up smaller gigs to fill in gaps or just choosing not to sleep for a week in an attempt to build some kind of buffer to our income. We do this because we are passionate about our vocation, but it’s not a hobby, it’s a job. Just like everyone else, we need money to survive. And we WILL need money. Our industry was the first hit and it will be one of the very last to recover.

As you binge watch your next series, or listen to that song you love, or read that book, consider the people who made that happen. All of the artists and workers behind the scenes whose names you will probably never know. We are not doing it for the glory, and we certainly aren’t in it for the money, but if you want to see new content in the future – new shows, new music, live events – we will need *some* money. We need to be at least included in the discussions, to be considered at least on par with the people working in food courts or clothes shops.

We need to be seen. We need to be considered.

We are calling for acknowledgement of the Arts and inclusion for all Arts workers in the Job Keeper scheme.

Thanks so much for your support for my campaign! Since I started this petition, there has been some exciting progress; college administrators agreed to help find a hotel where foster and homeless students were able to stay warm and safe during winter break . But even more importantly, Aquinas' administration agreed to establish a dialogue with experts and other universities to work toward a formal policy and solution on this issue-- both at Aquinas College and other small colleges whose students face similar challenges.

********

As an unaccompanied homeless youth, there were many barriers to getting into (and staying in!) college. Now that I'm lucky enough to be in my senior year at Aquinas College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, I'm about to face another challenge this winter break: I'll have nowhere to go when campus housing shuts down for winter break.

Because I was a homeless youth when I was finishing high school, college was a goal that I was not sure I would ever reach. Sure, I had thought about it, and knew that continuing my education post high school was one of the greatest keys to building a future for myself. I was excited when I was able to apply for and was accepted to a small college in my city, Aquinas College. While there were many challenges, with the help of a great organization in my community, Arbor Circle, I was able to secure on-campus housing and started at Aquinas College in the fall of 2010.

Since then, there have been numerous obstacles faced and countless challenges overcome. But one of the main barriers remains: housing. One of the most tricky situations for foster and homeless students in college is what to do for break periods. Conceded, this is also a difficult situation for schools. Aquinas College provides opportunities to rent on-campus apartments during the summer months, and allows international students and in-season athletes to maintain their housing over fall and spring breaks. However, homeless and foster students are not included in the spring and fall allowances, and are left without options for the two-to-three week period during Michigan's cold winters.

Colleges across the country have combatted the issue of break housing in multiple ways. Some have chosen to keep one housing unit open for the break to provide shelter to these students. This cuts down on the utility use for the college, and is one of many ways that the college could ensure safe and stable housing for a very vulnerable group of students throughout the year. Last year, I spent part of my winter break sleeping outside on campus and I know that I don't want to face the same experience again this year -- and I'm sure there are other students who also fear the same.

As a senior, I am anticipating to graduate this upcoming May with a double major in Sociology and Community Leadership. I have overcome many challenges, and cannot wait to dance across the stage in celebration of the work that I have done. However, it is my greatest hope that students who are in situations similar to mine, including several freshman with whom I share a dorm currently, are alleviated of this one major barrier during their college years. Plus, there are thousands of other students -- some who are homeless, some who were in foster care, others who have lost their parents or guardians -- who are also affected by this issue across the country. I am so proud to be an Aquinas College Saint, will be even more proud to be an Aquinas College Alum, and would be so beyond grateful if my Saints would put forth the effort to show that they are proud and supportive of students like me, as well.

Thanks for signing my petition, and as always-- GO SAINTS!~Jessie McCormick"

Amazon rainforest is BURNING!

The Amazon rainforest is burning at a record rate-- the highest on record since 2013 and an 83% increase from last year, Reuters reported. Earlier this month, Brazil declared a state of emergency over the rising number of fires in the region. So far this year, almost 73,000 fires in the country have been detected by Brazil's space research center, INPE.

What caused the fires?While the Amazon rainforest is typically wet and humid, July and August -- the onset of the dry season -- are the region's driest months, with ""activity"" peaking by early September and stopping by mid-November, according to NASA.

Fire is often used to clear out the land for farming or ranching. For that reason, the vast majority of the fires can be attributed to humans, Christian Poirier, program director of the nonprofit Amazon Watch, told CNN.

Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has said publicly that he thinks the fires were set by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in retaliation to funding cuts. Bolsonaro didn't provide any evidence for his claims and then later said he never accused any groups, according to the BBC.

What's the connection to climate change?

In a release Thursday, Greenpeace said that forest fires and climate change operate in a vicious circle. As the number of fires increase, greenhouse gas emissions do too. This makes the planet's overall temperature rise, the organization said. As the temperature increases, extreme weather events like major droughts happen more often.

""In addition to increasing emissions, deforestation contributes directly to a change in rainfall patterns in the affected region, extending the length of the dry season, further affecting forests, biodiversity, agriculture and human health,"" Greenpeace said in the release.

Which areas are affected?Satellite images show the fires in the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Rondonia, Para and Mato Grosso. The state of Amazonas is the most affected, according to Euronews.

The effects of damage to the Amazon go far beyond Brazil and its neighbors. The rainforest in the area generates over 20% of the world's oxygen and hosts 10% of the known biodiversity in the world. The Amazon is referred to as the ""lungs of the planet"" and plays an important role in climate regulation. The world would change drastically if the rain forest were to disappear, with impacts on everything from farms to drinking water.

The World Meteorological Organization, the UN meteorological arm, tweeted about fires on Thursday.

""Fires release pollutants including particulates and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and non-methane organic compounds in the atmosphere,"" the organization said.

Tell Bolsonaro’s government to save the Amazon Rainforest and protect the lands of Indigenous and traditional communities. Add your name today

Cosa ha causato gli incendi?Mentre la foresta pluviale è tipicamente umida e umida, luglio e agosto - la stagione secca - i mesi più secchi della regione, con ""attività"" che raggiungono il picco all'inizio di settembre e si fermano a metà novembre, secondo la NASA.

Il fuoco è l'agricoltura o l'allevamento. Per questo motivo, Christian Poirier, direttore del programma della non profit Amazon Watch, ha detto alla CNN.

Il presidente del Brasile, Jair Bolsonaro, ha dichiarato di ritenere che gli incendi siano stati provocati da organizzazioni non governative (ONG) come ritorsione ai tagli ai finanziamenti. Bolsonaro non ha fornito alcuna prova per le sue affermazioni e poi ha affermato di non aver mai accusato nessun gruppo, secondo la BBC.

Qual è la connessione ai cambiamenti climatici?

In una versione di giovedì, Greenpeace ha dichiarato che gli incendi boschivi e i cambiamenti climatici operano in un circolo vizioso. Con l'aumentare del numero di incendi, anche le emissioni di gas serra. Questo fa aumentare la temperatura complessiva del pianeta, ha affermato l'organizzazione. All'aumentare della temperatura, eventi meteorologici estremi come siccità maggiori si verificano più spesso.

""Oltre all'aumento delle emissioni, la deforestazione contribuisce direttamente al cambiamento dei modelli di precipitazioni nella regione interessata, prolungando la stagione secca, influenzando ulteriormente le foreste, la biodiversità, l'agricoltura e la salute umana"", ha dichiarato Greenpeace nel comunicato.

Quali aree sono interessate?Le immagini satellitari mostrano gli incendi negli stati brasiliani di Amazonas, Rondonia, Para e Mato Grosso. Lo stato di Amazonas è il più colpito, secondo Euronews.

Gli effetti dei danni all'Amazzonia vanno ben oltre il Brasile e i suoi vicini. La foresta pluviale della zona genera oltre il 20% dell'ossigeno del mondo ed ospita il 10% della biodiversità conosciuta nel mondo. L'Amazzonia è indicata come ""i polmoni del pianeta"" e svolge un ruolo importante nella regolazione del clima. Il mondo cambierebbe drasticamente se la foresta pluviale dovesse scomparire, con impatti su tutto, dalle fattorie all'acqua potabile.

L'Organizzazione meteorologica mondiale, il braccio meteorologico delle Nazioni Unite, ha twittato giovedì sugli incendi.

""Gli incendi rilasciano inquinanti tra cui particolato e gas tossici come monossido di carbonio, ossidi di azoto e composti organici non metanici nell'atmosfera"", ha affermato l'organizzazione.

ESPAÑOL

La selva amazónica está ardiendo a un ritmo récord, el más alto registrado desde 2013 y un aumento del 83% respecto al año pasado, informó Reuters. A principios de este mes, Brasil declaró un estado de emergencia por el creciente número de incendios en la región. Sé que este año, el centro de investigación espacial de Brasil, INPE, detectó casi 73,000 incendios en el país.

¿Qué causó los incendios?Mientras que la selva tropical es típicamente húmeda y húmeda, julio y agosto, la estación seca, son los meses más secos de la región, con una ""actividad"" que alcanza su punto máximo a principios de septiembre y se detiene a mediados de noviembre, según la NASA.

El fuego es la agricultura o la ganadería. Por esa razón, Christian Poirier, director del programa de la organización sin fines de lucro Amazon Watch, le dijo a CNN.

El presidente de Brasil, Jair Bolsonaro, dijo que cree que los incendios fueron provocados por organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG) en represalia por los recortes de fondos. Bolsonaro no proporcionó ninguna evidencia de sus afirmaciones y luego dijo que nunca acusó a ningún grupo, según la BBC.

¿Cuál es la conexión con el cambio climático?

En un comunicado el jueves, Greenpeace dijo que los incendios forestales y el cambio climático operan en un círculo vicioso. A medida que aumenta el número de incendios, las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero también lo hacen. Esto hace que la temperatura general del planeta aumente, dijo la organización. A medida que aumenta la temperatura, los eventos climáticos extremos, como las grandes sequías, ocurren con mayor frecuencia.

""Además de aumentar las emisiones, la deforestación contribuye directamente al cambio en los patrones de lluvia en la región afectada, extendiendo la estación seca, afectando aún más los bosques, la biodiversidad, la agricultura y la salud humana"", dijo Greenpeace en el comunicado.

¿Qué áreas están afectadas?Las imágenes satelitales muestran incendios en los estados brasileños de Amazonas, Rondonia, Para y Mato Grosso. El estado de Amazonas es el más afectado, según Euronews.

Los efectos del daño a la Amazonía van mucho más allá de Brasil y sus vecinos. La selva tropical del área genera más del 20% del oxígeno del mundo y alberga el 10% de la biodiversidad conocida del mundo. El Amazonas se conoce como los ""pulmones del planeta"" y juega un papel importante en la regulación del clima. El mundo cambiaría drásticamente si la selva tropical desapareciera, con impactos en todo, desde las granjas hasta el agua potable.

La Organización Meteorológica Mundial, el brazo meteorológico de las Naciones Unidas, tuiteó sobre los incendios el jueves.

""Los incendios liberan contaminantes que incluyen partículas y gases tóxicos como el monóxido de carbono, los óxidos de nitrógeno y los compuestos orgánicos no metanos a la atmósfera"", dijo la organización.

Dígale al gobierno de Bolsonaro que salve la selva amazónica y proteja las tierras de las comunidades indígenas y tradicionales. Agrega tu nombre hoy

La forêt amazonienne brûle à un rythme record - le plus haut record depuis 2013 et une augmentation de 83% par rapport à l'année dernière, a rapporté Reuters. Plus tôt ce mois-ci, le Brésil a déclaré l'état d'urgence en raison du nombre croissant d'incendies dans la région. Je sais que cette année, près de 73 000 incendies dans le pays ont été détectés par le centre de recherche spatiale brésilien, l'INPE.

Quelle est la cause des incendies?Alors que la forêt tropicale est généralement humide et humide, juillet et août - la saison sèche - sont les mois les plus secs de la région, avec une ""activité"" atteignant son maximum début septembre et s'arrêtant vers la mi-novembre, selon la NASA.

Le feu est l'agriculture ou l'élevage. Pour cette raison, Christian Poirier, directeur de programme de l’organisation à but non lucratif Amazon Watch, a déclaré à CNN.

Le président brésilien, Jair Bolsonaro, a déclaré qu'il pensait que les incendies auraient été incendiés par des organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) en guise de représailles pour les réductions de financement. Bolsonaro n'a fourni aucune preuve de ses affirmations et a ensuite affirmé qu'il n'avait jamais accusé aucun groupe, selon la BBC.

Quel est le lien avec le changement climatique?

Dans un communiqué publié jeudi, Greenpeace a déclaré que les incendies de forêt et le changement climatique opéraient dans un cercle vicieux. À mesure que le nombre d'incendies augmente, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre augmentent également. Cela fait monter la température globale de la planète, a déclaré l'organisation. Lorsque la température augmente, les phénomènes météorologiques extrêmes tels que les sécheresses majeures se produisent plus souvent.

""En plus d'augmenter les émissions, la déforestation contribue directement à modifier les régimes de précipitations dans la région touchée, prolongeant la saison sèche, affectant davantage les forêts, la biodiversité, l'agriculture et la santé humaine"", a déclaré Greenpeace dans son communiqué.

Quelles zones sont touchées?Des images satellites montrent des incendies dans les États brésiliens d'Amazonas, Rondonia, Para et Mato Grosso. Selon Euronews, l'état d'Amazonas est le plus touché.

Les dommages causés à l’Amazonie vont bien au-delà du Brésil et de ses voisins. La forêt pluviale de la région génère plus de 20% de l'oxygène dans le monde et abrite 10% de la biodiversité connue. L’Amazonie est considérée comme le ""poumon de la planète"" et joue un rôle majeur dans la régulation du climat. Le monde changerait radicalement si la forêt tropicale disparaissait, avec des impacts sur tout, des fermes à l'eau potable.

L'Organisation météorologique mondiale, la branche météorologique des Nations Unies, a tweeté au sujet des incendies jeudi.

""Les incendies libèrent dans l'atmosphère des polluants, notamment des particules et des gaz toxiques tels que le monoxyde de carbone, les oxydes d'azote et les composés organiques non méthaniques"", a déclaré l'organisation.

Across Nigeria, SARS officers have turned their duty to protect Nigerians into an opportunity for extortion and stealing money, property and other valuables belonging to suspects and their families.

Young people between the ages of 17 and 30 are most at risk of arrest, torture or extortion by SARS. They are often accused of being internet fraudsters and/or armed robbers. Young men with dreadlocks, ripped jeans, tattoos, flashy cars or expensive gadgets are frequently targeted by SARS.

Often these young men are unlawfully arrested in raids on television viewing centres, bars and recreational centres. They are held in detention and forced to pay huge bribes to secure their release. Those unable to pay are subjected to torture or other ill-treatment.

Students and staff members may be in risk if garbage facilities and containers are not properly kept. Students and staff are in serious problems if the problem with handling the trash around campus is not well managed; for instance, students that spills over or is left on the ground could cause someone to slide. As time passes and garbage is still not properly sorted, it may cause growth difficulties, respiratory issues, blood infections, and reproductive issues.

Waste management is an important responsibility that schools have but may find difficult to handle. By managing garbage, recycling, and trash removal well, a good waste plan can improve a facility on many levels. Because there will be less garbage to accumulate and a stronger waste disposal system in place, the school will be substantially cleaner. This is advantageous for the staff and students' health as well as for maintaining high standards and improving the school's reputation with outsiders. Schools are essential in teaching pupils how to properly handle waste, as we've already stated. By utilizing an effective waste management strategy to instruct this generation on how to recycle, keep spaces clean, and produce less garbage, a more sustainable generation will be produced.

In order to put waste reduction and prevention strategies in place, we have created this petition. By offering adequate trash bins made of recycled materials and putting the 3 R's and CLAYGO policies into practice. This aims to have a better and clean environment.

Immigration detentions are needed in countries where refugees and asylum seekers fleeing wars zones and human rights oppression can be evaluated and integrated or differentiated from other economic migrants. But Bicutan Immigration facility does not hold one asylum seeker, one refugee or even one migrate worker.

So why does B.I. Bicutan hold 200 plus detainees?  The answer is simple:  Money!

Bicutan Immigration facility is NOT about displaced persons. Instead it is all about illegally extorting money from foreigners who are perceived as being rich, even though many of them are not.

Greedy BI officials will even go so far as to kidnap and hold foreigners to extort their money. Nobody is bailed by BI because it’s not good for business. Keep them as long as possible and make them pay. Safe drinking water is sold to detainees at double street price. The use of phones should be free to detainees under the Geneva Convention.

In addition, any trivial visa issue which could be dealt with in one or two days will take months or even years to resolve. What better victim can you have than one you can rob and then deport so there’s no come back!

Many of foreign nationals being detained are NOT criminals. Most of them simply overstayed their visa. A simple deportation should only take maximum of a week. But many of these foreigners have been held in detention for months, some of them years!

Your Senate knows the truth. Senators Drilon and Trillanes introduced a new Immigration Act last year to put an end to it. Under this new act BI will not be able to pick up innocent foreigners like they do and BI will have to deal with deportations in days, not years. They won’t be able to keep anybody for more than three months and all extraditions will have to be done without delays.

With the new Immigration Act we don’t need Bicutan. BI should never hold more than a handful at any time.

Bicutan is hurting all of us and the Philippines! Do you want a greedy few in BI to stop visitors coming to these beautiful islands? We need foreign investment for jobs. Why let a greedy few spoil it for all?

Please give us your support and help us press congress and the senate to enact the new Immigration law and close Bicutan now!"

I used to live in Gauteng, where there were no government organization requirements of having a piece of paper that decides whether or not you may save an animal. After moving down to the Western Cape, I found that the wildlife in this province needed help from someone that is able, has the knowledge and experience, and no matter the danger or difficulties, the person needed to be able to put that all aside.

I decided to become that person. I made myself available to the entire Helderberg community, and have been saving all sorts of animals since 2016 in the Helderberg area. Most of the injured wildlife I rescue and take to receive medical attention, was done so out of my own pocket. After many members of the community insisted that I start asking a fee for rescue calls, I decided to rather give the community the option of paying a fee to help with transport and medical costs, or not. Either way, I never turn down a call for help or an animal in need.

I also took in unwanted exotic snakes and spiders that people had as pets, and found out that I needed to have permits for the animals in my care. After speaking to an employee of Cape Nature, asking for permits for the snakes in my care, I was then 2 weeks later opening my door to Cape Nature, SAPS Stock Theft Unit and a search warrant. I was then charged for having wildlife without permits.

3 years later, and after many postponements for unknown reasons, I face myself with another criminal charge for transportation of wildlife without permits. I had an emergency on hand, loaded a seal pup that was in need of immediate medical attention into my vehicle on instruction from Houtbay Seal Rescue, with 5 Puffadders in a tub due for release, and 1 Cape Cobra, also due for release. All 6 snakes were caught over a period of 2 days. I was arrested, and kept in jail for 30 hours.

Cape Nature is trying to stop me from saving animals and ensuring the conservation of our wildlife, and is pushing the court to punish me to the fullest extent. Please sign this petition if you are opposed to Cape Nature continuing the attempt of shutting down Helderberg Wildlife Rescue, and in favor of all charges withdrawn.

Animals do not have a voice, and can not help themselves when it comes to medical care, getting themselves in tricky or dangerous situations.

- A large number of these dogs are family owned pets stolen from their homes or out the front of the houses they protect.

- The slaughter is brutal and in-humane. Dogs feet and mouths are hog tied and beaten to death (believing it makes the meat more tender). They are then skinned and boiled or fried - some still alive at this point.

- There are approximately 70 public RW restaurants in Bali that cater to the local demographic

- The local community have have been told various fallacies about eating dog meat such as it cures the common cold or makes them more virile. This is simply NOT true!

- Rabies is present on the island. The RW Restaurants claim the extreme temperature of cooking will kill the virus however there are several proven cases of rabies being contracted through dog meat consumption which is a human health risk.

Pao lost her gender discrimination case against venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins, on March 27, 2015. A vast majority of the Reddit community believes that Pao, ""a manipulative individual who will sue her way to the top"", has overstepped her boundaries and fears that she will run Reddit into the ground. Alternative sites to Reddit.com have sprung up and have received vast amounts of traffic within the recent months.

The communication between the Reddit administration team to its subreddit moderators is very lacking and rather unsettling after years of empty promises to the moderators to improve and provide tools to help run subreddits, and ultimately Reddit as a whole, smoothly.

Advance Publications needs to fix this ordeal or risk irreversible harm to their international brand, Reddit Inc.

Action must be taken to prevent Reddit from being further run into the ground."

Le candidat Macron le déclarait lors de sa campagne présidentielle : « Un homme ou une femme qui demande asile en France, qui met sa vie en danger, s’est battu pour sa liberté et celle de sa famille est quelqu’un, en vertu de nos principes, qui doit être accueilli. » (1) Un discours qui, rappelons-le, faisait alors barrage au Front national.

Le projet de loi « asile et immigration », qui a été présenté mercredi 21 février en Conseil des ministres et qui sera discuté en commission à l’Assemblée nationale au mois de mars, est pourtant loin de cette philosophie. Aujourd’hui, si nous sommes en marche, c’est vers l’abolition du principe même de la demande d’asile en France et la fabrication massive d’une population sans statut, sans toit, sans droits et sans ressources sur notre sol.

Car nous sommes face aujourd’hui à des femmes, des enfants, des hommes fuyant toutes sortes de tragédies. Si les personnes exilées sont certes plus nombreuses à venir chercher refuge parmi nous depuis l’été 2015, elles représentent cependant à peine 1 % de la population européenne. Nous n’assistons donc pas à une « crise migratoire », mais bien à une crise tragique de l’hospitalité, laquelle est pourtant, selon le président Macron, « notre honneur et notre tradition » (2).

Les atrocités et les souffrances vécues par les personnes exilées ne s’arrêtent pas une fois les côtes européennes atteintes. Et alors qu’elles devraient trouver asile et répit une fois arrivées en France, elles sont au contraire souvent en butte à une maltraitance administrative et policière qui les amène à se cacher, où elles le peuvent, pour fuir encore et encore ce qu’elles pensaient désormais derrière elles.

Ne les laissez pas mener cette politique en notre nom

Nous, habitants, citoyens, contribuables, électeurs, représentants associatifs de ce pays, qui croyons en nos valeurs, héritées de la Révolution de 1789 et rappelées dans la Déclaration universelle des droits de l’Homme de 1948, en notre histoire de résistance et en nos institutions, sommes horrifiés qu’une telle politique puisse être menée en notre nom aujourd’hui.

Comment nos « principes » pourraient-ils être en accord avec un projet de loi qui conduira à l’enfermement en centre de rétention et à l’expulsion systématisée d’hommes, de femmes et d’enfants ayant déjà tellement souffert sur les routes de l’exil ? D’hommes et de femmes qui n’attendent de notre part que la reconnaissance de leurs souffrances, et de notre pays que sa protection, en vertu du droit international établi au sortir de la Seconde Guerre mondiale ?

Comment ne pas s’insurger quand déjà une proposition de loi est venue donner le pouvoir aux préfets d’enfermer avant expulser les demandeurs d'asile dits « dublinés » ? Des hommes et des femmes dont le seul tort est d’avoir eu leurs empreintes digitales prises de force au cours de leur parcours d’exil – parfois dans des États où le nationalisme a déjà triomphé, et qui n'hésitent pas à les réexpédier vers leur pays en guerre !

Nous avons cru que ces personnes trouveraient enfin en France, pays des Droits de l’Homme, des moyens pour se reconstruire. Nous y croyons encore. Mais le projet de loi « asile et immigration » organise au contraire la réduction des droits des demandeurs d’asile, limite leurs délais de recours et augmente la durée de leur rétention de façon à intensifier ces expulsions.

C'est votre vote que l'Histoire retiendra

Cette politique est et sera onéreuse, inefficace et inhumaine, plongeant des êtres humains, des familles entières dans la clandestinité et dans une terrible précarité. Elle plonge la France dans la honte, celle d’être incapable d’honorer ses propres principes.

Nous, habitants, citoyens, contribuables, électeurs, représentants associatifs de ce pays, vous demandons de prendre les responsabilités que requiert le combat pour la dignité humaine. Ne participez pas à l’écriture de nouvelles pages d’Histoire que nous ne saurons expliquer à nos enfants.

À notre échelle, nous avons, au quotidien, hébergé quelques personnes pour en laisser des centaines dehors, distribué quelques repas pour nous rendre compte que ce n’était pas encore suffisant, offert quelques tentes et sacs de couchages pour constater, au petit matin, leur destruction par la police. Pour de telles actions, certaines et certains d’entre nous se retrouvent devant les tribunaux, coupables de  délit de solidarité.

Nous vous demandons de prendre acte, à nos côtés, de cet enjeu politique et moral en rejetant le projet de loi « asile et immigration », et en entamant des discussions avec la société civile et les associations de terrain pour présenter une politique d'accueil digne de notre pays, conforme aux engagements du Président et non aux idées qu’il prétendait battre dans les urnes.

Nous comptons sur vous.

Bullying is a problem that affects millions of students of all races and classes. 1 out of 4 kids is bullied and 42% of kids have been bullied while online. Child and teen Bullying and Cyberbullying are at an all-time high. Some kids are so tormented that suicide has become an alternative for them. It has everyone worried. Not just the kids on its receiving end, but the parents and others who may not understand how extreme bullying can get.

Bullying and Cyberbullying continue to harm kids physically, emotionally and the worst -- it continues to take lives.

Just ask the family and friends of Jamie Rodemeyer, Kameron Jacobsen, Amanda Diane Cummings, Alexis Pilkington (New York),Tyler Clementi (New Jersey), Asher Brown (Texas), Scott Walz (Illinois), Christian Taylor (Virginia), Suade Cooley, Phoebe Prince, and Carl Joseph Walker-Hoover (Massachusetts), Matt Epling and Alex Harrison (Michigan), Jesse Logan (Ohio), Justin Aaberg (Minnesota), Celina Okwuone and Hope Witsell (Florida), Megan Meier (Missouri), Ryan Halligan (Vermont) and ALL of the others who took their lives because they were tormented on a daily basis.

They might be here today if their schools had listened – if their schools took action and a stand against all forms of bullying -- including cyberbullying. They might be here today if the country had standardized legislation mandating schools to not only enforce a ""No Tolerance"" policy against bullying and cyberbullying -- but get involved and help the students -- rather than sweeping it under the rug.

New Jersey and Massachusetts passed landmark legislation which requires schools to institute anti-bullying curriculum, investigate acts of bullying and report the most serious cases to law enforcement officers. New Jersey passed the toughest anti-bullying legislation in the country.

Yet, all the legislation in the world won't matter if our schools ignore this epidemic, as the majority of America's schools are sweeping this issue under the rug. They take no responsibility in keeping our children safe.

We ask you to pass strict, unified and national legislation throughout the country mandating that our schools help and protect our children, and enforce 'no tolerance' policies and anti-bullying legislation (including cyberbullying) so that our children can be safe in school and online.

We ask that every school across the country have at least one trained person in bullying prevention who a student can go to at any time if they are being harassed or feel they are in danger and get immediate assistance.

The cost of bullying and cyberbullying to our society is great and so are its effects. If we don't ”STOP BULLYING NOW” Out all forms of bullying now, we will lose more children to suicide, create a society of kids with post traumatic syndrome, and kids so full of hatred and violence that they grow up to be workplace bullies, and worse -- with even a greater cost to business and society.

Please help to “STOP BULLYING NOW” and Cyberbullying!

She was told, ""GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY"" after the woman hostilely took one of the two firepits from her that she was planning to purchase, and when Xuna followed her to the checkout station with her cellphone camera on to demand an apology, another employee, David, blocked access to Jennifer and her mother, dismissed her request, and repeatedly demanded that she stop recording and erase her video. David kept demanding that Xuna erase the video because he claimed that she ""was making [the incident] something bigger than it was.""

However, Lowe's should know that for an Asian American to be told to ""Go back to your country,"" is to experience an unfortunately too common example of anti-Asian hate and racism. Asian Americans have been in the US for more than 175 years and those of us who live here have every right to call it home. The United States is our country too, so for someone who sees an Asian face and says ""GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY,"" they are assuming foreignness and expressing their belief that we do not belong in this country as much as a white person does, and that is just plain wrong. That's blatantly racist and wrong.

We demand that Lowe's acknowledge that their employees were wrong to stand by and allow this racial bullying and harassment to take place and repeatedly deny that anything wrong had happened. We further demand that Lowe's require racial sensitivity training for their employees so that they treat all customers, regardless of racial background, with respect and dignity at their stores. Ms. Hu simply wanted to shop in peace at your store and was reserving two firepits while her father went to get a cart to take them to checkout. When the offending customer went up to her to demand that she give up one of the firepits, simply because she had not yet paid for them, your employees could have taken the opportunity to find another firepit for the other customer to purchase. You could have sold three firepits instead of two and supported racial equity on Martin Luther King Day. Instead, your employees defended a racist bully and allowed her to have her way, while an Asian American customer was deprived of dignity and respect, treated like she did not matter and as if she did not deserve to spend her hard-earned money like everyone else at your store, and that for her to be racially harassed and told to ""Go back to your country"" was an acceptable experience for Asian Americans to have at Lowe's. The video and Ms. Hu's account of what happened to her can be found on her Facebook page. We, the undersigned, urge Lowe's to do the right thing.

Not knowing what was happening, I went to the doctor and was wrongly diagnosed with asthma. They had overlooked that my symptoms could be caused by something mental rather than something physical. I didn’t truly get the help I needed until I was in my thirties – and in the meantime, I developed toxic coping strategies including an eating disorder which lasted 7 years. I think a big part of the problem was that the people around me - doctors, teachers, family and employers - didn't know how to respond or care for me as they would have done if my illness had been physical.

I don’t want other people to suffer in silence as long as I did, so ever since I have been fighting to change our relationship with mental health - I’m a campaigner for better mental health support - and now I’ve joined forces in partnership with some of your favorite brands, from Heat magazine, Grazia and Empire, to Kiss FM, Magic Radio and Absolute Radio, to start this petition calling for all businesses and colleges to introduce mental health first aiders.

The workplace is where we spend most of our adult lives but unfortunately it’s also a place that, in my experience, mental well-being is the most neglected. We feel the need to soldier on when we are struggling with mental illness in a way we never would if we had the flu or broken a leg.

And this is reflected in our laws. Under the Health and Safety at work act, most workplaces have to train someone in medical first aid - it means if we come to work and end up getting hurt or sick, there’s someone that knows what to do. Unfortunately, despite statistics showing 1 in 4 of us struggle with mental health every year, most workplaces don’t have anyone on hand that knows how to help.

Evidence shows the earlier a mental health issue - like stress, anxiety or depression - is detected the easier it is to manage and treat.  By making it easier for people to talk about their mental health at work & and by training colleagues on site who know where to point people to get the help, we could dramatically improve the mental well-being of the country.

Mental Health First Aid courses are available, and whilst most organisations don’t have them, those that do (like Unilever and Ford) have found them to be transformative.

Please join me in calling on Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Steve Barclay to commit to updating the Health and Safety At Work Act to ensure that businesses have the same obligation to provide mental health first aiders as they do medical first aiders.

Несмотря на это, наше исследование показало, что многим производителям наплевать на гуманность и они не спешат переходить на применение СУЩЕСТВУЮЩИХ безопасных альтернатив, позволяющих перестать наконец издеваться над кроликами, кошками, собаками, грызунами и другими четверолапыми ради красоты и чистоты.

Цель данной петиции – обратить внимание российских производителей на то, что в 2021 г., при наличии возможности отказаться от тестирования косметики, парфюмерии и бытовой химии на животных, продолжать мучить животных в лабораториях просто жестоко, аморально и бессмысленно.

Вот некоторые из этих производителей и их самые популярные бренды:

Этот производитель является также владельцем бренда «Natura Siberica», который позиционирует себя этичным, однако к нему много вопросов, с момента скандала, поднятого общественностью, по поводу косметики на основе пантов марала (вследствие публичного скандала компания быстро сняла этот продукт с производства и продаж) и заканчивая и поныне существующими продуктами на основе чёрной икры (https://naturasiberica.ru/products/ukhod-za-litsom/kontsentrat-chernoy-ikry-kletochnoe-vosstanovlenie/), молока яка (https://naturasiberica.ru/products/ukhod-dlya-muzhchin/ledyanoy-gel-posle-britya-yak-i-yeti/) и т.п.

Будучи потребителями косметики и бытовой химии, каждый из нас имеет рычаг воздействия на производителей: наш выбор - наш кошелек.

Ваш выбор продукции - это голос за или против жестокости по отношению к невинным животным.

Подписывая эту петицию, я подтверждаю, что не буду покупать продукцию  компаний (список выше) до тех пор, пока они не перейдут на более современные и безопасные способы тестирования, не причиняя вреда беззащитным животным.

Воодушевленные продуктами, не приносящими вреда животным, потребители всё больше смотрят на состав и производственные процессы своей косметики.

Вместе  мы можем надавить на производителей силой неравнодушных потребителей, отказываясь покупать продукцию, ингредиент которой - жестокость к братьям нашим меньшим.

Немного фактов и ситуация на данный момент.

Сейчас практически любой производитель скажет вам, что не тестирует свою продукцию на животных. Отчасти это правда — бренды самостоятельно не проводят никаких исследований. Вместо этого они покупают уже протестированные на животных ингредиенты у специализирующихся на этом компаний и лабораторий. Данная продукция НЕ ЯВЛЯЕТСЯ этичной.

Некоторые бренды разрабатывают собственный значок, показывающий, что их продукт является веганским и не тестируется на животных. В таких случаях проверить подлинность заявления весьма затруднительно. Спрашивать продавцов —  не самый эффективный способ, так как их цель продать свой продукт, а на вопросы этики многие закрывают глаза.

ЕДИНСТВЕННЫЙ ДОСТОВЕРНЫЙ СПОСОБ – ОБРАТИТЬ ВНИМАНИЕ, КАКОЙ ГРУППЕ КОМПАНИЙ ПРИНАДЛЕЖИТ ТА ИЛИ ИНАЯ МАРКА ПРОДУКЦИИ.

Если компания, владеющая брендом, входит в черный список, скорее всего и марка не является cruelty-free. Да, бывают и исключения: многие крупные компании на этом рынке специально создают веганские марки, так как спрос на косметику, которая не тестируется на животных, за последние 5 лет сильно вырос.

В нашей прошлой петиции я и все вы, наши сторонники, поддержавшие ее, обращались к властям с требованием ввести запрет на тестирование парфюмерно-косметической продукции на животных. Пройдя трудный путь, собрав множество (более 400 тысяч) подписей, получив поддержку порядочного депутата из партии «Справедливая Россия» Сергея Доронина и разработав законопроект, мы НЕ получили поддержки в ГосДуме (в первую очередь, со стороны правящей партии).

И всё же наша работа не прошла зря.

При ввозе в РФ закон обязывает получать сертификаты и декларации ЕАС, продажа косметики без этих сертификатов — штрафы и конфискации партий, а для сертификации требуются испытания по ТР ТС: например, кроликам в глаза заливают АНА-кислоты и смотрят, за сколько времени пилинг разъест глаз. Животные кричат, стонут и умирают в муках! С чистящими средствами еще хуже — их заливают в желудок и ждут, когда чистящее водопроводные трубы средство растворит кишечник животного. Естественно, животное в агонии! Смерть неизбежна. Долгая, мучительная смерть.

Так вот, почему всё сделанное нами было не зря.

В приложение 8 (касающееся токсикологических показателей безопасности парфюмерно-косметической продукции) Технического Регламента Таможенного Союза «О безопасности парфюмерно-косметической продукции» (ТР ТС 009/2011) потихоньку (несмотря на отклонение нашего законопроекта о запрете тестирования косметики на животных, если имеются гуманные альтернативы) были внесены изменения, которые установили, что и токсикологические испытания (т.е. не только клинические) могут проводиться на альтернативных моделях (а не только на лабораторных животных): http://docs.cntd.ru/document/420331180

Дословно: ""Примечание. Токсикологическая оценка проводится либо путем определения кожно-раздражающего действия и действия на слизистые (с использованием лабораторных животных), либо путем определения общетоксического действия (альтернативными методами in vitro)."".

То есть теперь ЛЮБЫЕ испытания можно заменить альтернативными!

А значит, даже в отсутствие в России закона, ЗАПРЕЩАЮЩЕГО тестирование на животных, каждый из нас может и должен прилагать усилия к тому, чтобы развивались аккредитованные испытательные лаборатории (центры), которые тестируют продукцию на альтернативных биологических моделях.

С предыдущей петиции и внесения изменений прошло 5 лет. Производители продолжают тестировать, несмотря на возможность отказаться от жестокости.

Ежегодно в лабораториях убивают более 150 миллионов животных при тестировании косметики, лекарств и бытовой химии! Скажите, стоит ли «красота» подобных жертв?

Мировая практика показывает, что решительная и информированная общественность является движущей силой перемен!

Существующие сегодня современные альтернативы, не уступают, а наоборот превосходят по точности и достоверности устаревшие и жестокие вивисекционные тесты. Учёные могут вырастить в  лабораториях целые органы! На дворе XXI век, технологии шагнули очень далеко.

Животные, используемые в тестировании косметики, страдают напрасно, так как косметические компании в состоянии создавать качественные и безопасные продукты, используя тысячи доступных ингредиентов, которые имеют историю безопасного использования и не требуют каких-либо новых испытаний.

Современные методы сочетают в себе тесты на клетках человека и сложные компьютерные модели, дающие точные результаты с меньшими затратами средств и времени, чем тесты на животных.

Больно и дико осознавать, что до сих пор проще издеваться над теми, кто не может сказать слова против, кто вообще не способен ответить. А что, если бы они могли выразить свое мнение? Не хочется поднимать тему геноцида и прочих человеческих катастроф, когда людей ставили на одну ступень с безмолвными животными и они точно так же не имели возможности сказать «нет» (а если и пробовали, то исход был очевиден).

Вряд ли нашли бы положительный отклик опыты с тушью, «выедающей глаза» человеку (или, например, беззащитному ребенку), который при этом кричит от боли. Может, все-таки, нам, как высшему звену эволюции, пора научиться думать не только о себе и почаще вспоминать о том, что животные, точно так же, как люди, чувствуют боль, страх, беспомощный ужас?

Если вы являетесь представителем какой-либо из этих компаний и считаете, что в списке есть неточность или ваша компания уже прекратила практиковать жестокие испытания на животных, сообщите, пожалуйста, об этом на электронную почту forgottenanimalsrussia@gmail.com, и мы исключим вас из этого списка. В качестве доказательств вам в обязательном порядке необходимо будет представить протоколы испытаний всей вашей продукции (а не одного «этичного» бренда) in vitro.

==

Мы же все вместе обращаемся к собственникам и управляющиму персоналу вышеуказанных компаний – остановите тестирование Вашей продукции на животных и прекратите закупать ингредиенты, которые продолжают тестироваться на животных! Уже сегодня многие российские производители косметики и парфюмерии прекратили тесты на животных благодаря тому, что это стало возможно.

Инициируйте партнерство с государственными органами, способными повлиять на введение полного запрета на тестирование парфюмерно-косметической продукции и бытовой химии на животных, чтобы ваши компании приобрели репутацию организаций, которые уважают мнение потребителя, благополучие ВСЕХ живых существ и готовы к диалогу с прогрессивным обществом.



В качестве положительного примера вышеуказанным компаниям следует ориентироваться на ООО «Юнилевер Русь» (https://www.unilever.ru/) и АО ""Колгейт-Палмолив"" (https://www.colgatepalmolive.ru/): после введения возможности альтернативного тестирования они отказались от тестирования на животных там, где это возможно.

Подобные примеры показывают, что вивисекция не является необходимой, и ее можно устранить, если только у ученых и производителей есть необходимая мотивация.

Немного «живых» деталей о вивисекции, или О чем плачут кролики

Трудно найти лучшую иллюстрацию бессмысленности и дикости вивисекции, чем тест Драйза. Для измерения токсичности на глаза животных, находящихся в сознании, наносят шампуни, пестициды, средства от сорняков, глазные вещества, бытовые моющие средства, даже слезоточивые газы. Выбор кроликов не обусловлен какими-либо научными соображениями, просто они стоят дешево, доступны, неагрессивны, и у них большие глаза, что упрощает оценку результатов. На самом деле кроличий глаз – это плохая модель человеческого глаза, и в научной литературе данный тест часто критиковался (R.Sharpe, Food & Chemical Toxicology, 1985, vol.23, 139-143).

Но тест Драйза не только иллюстрирует некоторые из наихудших аспектов научной практики, он также показывает, как бороться с вивисекцией. Потому что положение начало меняться в 1980-е годы, когда организации по защите животных сконцентрировали внимание на тесте. Через 10 лет использовались либо находились в стадии разработки 60 методик работы в пробирке, и некоторые компании перестали использовать кроликов (C.G.Shayne in Benchmarks: Alternative Methods in Toxicology, Ed. M.A.Mellman (Princeton Scientific Publishing Co.Inc., 1989). В Британии, где ежегодно фиксируется число экспериментов на животных, использование кроликов в тестах на раздражимость глаза сократилось с 13000 в 1980 году до 3242 в 1992.

ЭТО ДОКАЗЫВАЕТ, ЧТО, ЕСЛИ НАПРАВИТЬ ОБЩЕСТВЕННОЕ ДАВЛЕНИЕ В НУЖНОЕ РУСЛО, ЭТО ВЛИЯЕТ НА ПРОЦЕССЫ В НАУКЕ И ПРОИЗВОДСТВЕ.

Исследования на животных ничему не учат нас о здоровье человека, потому что животные разных видов поглощают, метаболизируют и выводят вещества иначе, чем люди. Правда в том, что тестирование на животных в реальности вовсе не является научным: оно ненадежно и совершенно не нужно. Сторонники вивисекции часто подчеркивают, что в большей части исследований используются крысы, мыши и кролики, а не, скажем, кошки и собаки. Это делается потому, что люди меньше будут возражать, потому что грызуны не очень популярны среди большинства. Кроме того, их легко кормить, за ними просто ухаживать и работать с ними нетрудно; они доступны и дешевы. Но эта тактика может привести к неожиданным неприятным последствиям, потому что опора на этих животных служит очень сильным аргументом против заявления, что вивисекция каким-то образом научна.

О КАКОЙ НАУЧНОСТИ МОЖНО ГОВОРИТЬ, КОГДА ВЫБОР ВИДОВ ТАК ЧАСТО ЗАВИСИТ ОТ ТАКИХ НЕНАУЧНЫХ ФАКТОРОВ, КАК ЦЕНА И УДОБСТВО?

Некоторые компании утверждают, что они должны тестировать на животных, потому что они продают свою продукцию в таких странах, как Китай, где тестирование на животных все еще требуется по закону для компаний, импортирующих в страну. Но на самом деле это не так. Они решили продавать в Китае, зная, что это будет означать новые испытания на животных. Вот почему косметическое тестирование на животных не заканчивается.

Поскольку эксперименты на животных являются жестокими, дорогостоящими и, как правило, неприменимыми к человеку, самые дальновидные ученые мира перешли к разработке и использованию методов изучения болезней и тестирования продуктов, которые заменяют животных и действительно имеют отношение к здоровью человека. Эти альтернативы тестированию на животных включают сложные тесты с использованием человеческих клеток и тканей (методы in vitro), передовые методы компьютерного моделирования (модели In silico) и исследования с участием добровольцев-людей. Этим и другим неживотным методам не мешают видовые различия, которые делают применение результатов испытаний на животных к людям трудным или невозможным, и они обычно занимают меньше времени и денег.

Простой факт: когда исследователи не могут использовать животных, они всегда находят возможность для достижения целей использовать другие методы. Необходимость становится матерью изобретения. Например, хотя животные традиционно используются для проверки эффективности вакцин, этот подход не сработал при оценке вакцины от пневмонии, потому что организмы, вызывающие ее, не действуют на лабораторных животных. В результате ученые разработали альтернативный метод, основанный на химическом анализе и работе с добровольцами (J.B.Robbins, Journal of Infection, 1979, vol.1, suppl.2, 61-72).

Если мы хотим, чтобы косметическое тестирование на животных было когда-нибудь запрещено и в нашей стране, а косметические компании уже сейчас отказались от этих средневековых (несмотря на цивилизованную обертку и глянец) практик, то нам нужно объединиться.

Подписывая эту петицию, вы делаете шаг к прекращению страданий миллионов животных через использование гораздо более безопасных и гуманных методов тестирования.

Пожалуйста, подпишите петицию и поделитесь ею со своими друзьями в соцсетях. Давайте вместе попытаемся сделать Россию гуманнее.

Спасибo!

The self-employed - independent contracting professional performing artists of California demand to be exempted from the AB5 law which limits the use of classifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees by companies in the state.

Here is why:

AB5 is based on an inaccurate assumption that the Professional Performing Arts field and those who hire professional performing artists do not practice legal, ethical standards and that somehow professional performing artists are complicit or incapable of self-regulating their own legal, ethical standards as a working professional performing artist.

Due to the already historic, common time based constructs of professional performing arts work - working as few as one to several hours on one job or weeks and hours that are in-continuos at one or several companies, where pay scale and conditions are in fact mutually negotiated and negotiable by the artists and where the creative/artistic process literally comes from and therefore determined by the artist already makes the professional performing artist exempt by both the ABC and Borello tests being applied to determine classification for AB5.

Here, we are defining Professional Performing Artists as creative and co-creative professional occupations including but not limited to: actors, directors, dancers, choreographers, musicians including singers, composers and fine artists including but not limited to: creative painters which includes muralists, sculptors, etc.

It is our opinion that, the current exemption including Fine Artist is not necessarily inclusive of Professional Performing Artists dependent upon independent interpretations of the current Fine Artist exemption and therefore, demands more explicit language that confirms Professional Performing Artists are in fact exempt from AB5 as ASM Lorena Gonzalez has stated it does publicly.

Also, it is not clear as of yet if ASM Gonzalez has the legal authority to jeopardize US citizens rights to be self-employed.

The Professional performing arts and professional performing artists contribute to the statewide economy and help cultivate, design and inspire the quality of life composite that makes California a place to live as well as visit.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

Professional Performing Arts Unions (AEA, AFTRA-SAG, etc.) alongside other Labor Unions are in fact influencing ASM Gonzalez's decision making. However, here in lies the problem. Only the minority of professional performing artists are members of unions and only the minority of companies, theaters, performing arts centers across California are fully unionized.

AB5 strengthens and protects the minority, not the majority who will ultimately lose work and their right to work independently through self-employment altogether.

Non-union companies, theaters, performing arts centers will dissolve and those who re-organize will have less employment to offer the minority.

Our Creative workforce and Creative jobs across California will shrink altogether.

The Professional Performing Arts across California will immediately become less diverse and less relevant to the wants and needs of its residents.



FINAL INFO: There is a discussion now to create a new union for ""gig workers"" - which would be the same or similar as current unions with: group based insurance, group based retirement, contract oversight, and of course union dues/membership. Average membership for current performing arts unions is $1,000 annual, plus pay into benefits - stuff to keep in mind and to weigh the difference between this option and independent choices (public insurance, RothIRA with a broker, etc.)"

Background
On 22 an indigenous Marma family. Two men raped the 18-year-old sister and seriously sexually assaulted","['Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina', 'Government of Bangladesh', 'Ban Ki-moon (Secretary-General of the United Nations)', 'United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations', 'Donor Nations']",Ina Hume,"Bristol, ENG, United Kingdom",14596,"Mar. 10, 2018",https://assets.change.org/photos/3/bb/el/AvBBeLcHlkOtXkC-800x450-noPad.jpg?1521059336,"We the undersigned individuals and organisations are deeply concerned about the recent incident of sexual violence against two indigenous Marma sisters on 22/1/18 [1] and assaults on Rani Yan Yan (the Chakma Queen) and Women Human Rights Defenders on 15/2/18 [2] in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh perpetrated by Bangladesh military and security forces.

Human rights groups report there has been a concerted and coordinated effort to cover up the rape and sexual assault [3] and also attempts to impose a mainstream media blackout [4].

Incidents of rape and sexual assault are common in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, with a young Tripura girl reportedly raped on International Womens’ Day [5]. From 2014 to June 2017, there have been 297 reported cases [6] of violence against indigenous women and girls none of these cases have been properly prosecuted, nor the perpetrators punished.  Rape and sexual violence targeting indigenous women and girls are part of a systematic and brutal strategy to terrorise the indigenous communities and displace them from their lands. [7]

Background

On 22 January 2018 a patrol party from Farua Army Camp carried out house to house searches in Orasori village, Bilaichari district in Rangamati, Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh They entered the house of an indigenous Marma family. Two men raped the 18-year-old sister and seriously sexually assaulted the younger 14-year-old sister.  Their seven-year-old brother was present in the room.

The following day the sisters were taken to hospital for treatment. Whilst at the hospital they were placed under tight surveillance, unlawfully detained [8] and subjected to degrading treatment.  Rani Yan-Yan and other women’s human rights defenders attended the sisters for 20 consecutive days, to provide support and to bear witness to their treatment. One of the reasons Rani Yan Yan visited the sisters, is because she is also from the Marma indigenous group and can communicate with the sisters in their mother tongue. The sisters said they were scared to return to their village, for fear of retaliation for speaking out.  A writ was filed to release the sisters into the protective custody of Raja Devasish Roy and Rani Yan Yan. [9]

Attack on Rani Yan Yan and Women Human Rights Defender

The parents of the two girls, having allegedly been placed under extreme pressure from the Bangladeshi security forces, filed a counter-writ for their daughters’ release, which was upheld on the 13/2/18.  This led to a raid on the hospital by security forces and plain-clothes personnel when the sisters were forcibly taken from the hospital (15/3/18). Rani Yan-Yan and a woman human rights defender were assaulted, kicked and beaten trying to protect the sisters who were refusing to leave.  A physical assault of such magnitude on Rani Yan Yan is tantamount to an attack on all the indigenous people of the Chakma Circle. The Chakma Raj is held in high esteem and is considered to be the custodians of centuries-old traditions and way of life.

Accountability and Scrutiny

There is an intense lack of scrutiny of the situation facing Indigenous peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh.  It is notable that Bangladesh is the largest contributing country to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (UN DPKO).  It is abhorrent to think of perpetrators of such crimes serving as UN Peacekeepers.  We welcome the statement made by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (4/3/16) pledging reforms to improve accountability for abuse by peacekeepers including measures for stricter vetting of new UN personnel and quicker investigations. [10]

International Scrutiny and Safeguarding

It is commendable the international community is acting to combat the sexual exploitation and abuse of vulnerable women and children in communities by aid workers from International NGOs such as Oxfam and Save the Children.  However, the same level of scrutiny and accountability is required for all recipients of aid, including Bangladesh, especially when there are credible reports of vulnerable women and children and being sexually abused by those in power and having little or no means of holding those in power to account for their crimes.

Recommendations:

We call on Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the Government of Bangladesh to:

We further request assurance from the Government of Bangladesh to take all precautions to ensure that there is proper scrutiny of all personnel, including military from Bangladesh prior to serving in the United Nations to certify ‘they have not committed or are alleged to have committed criminal offences and/or violations of international law..’

We would like to make the following recommendations to the United Nations and the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations to improve the accountability of both civilian and military personnel serving the UN. We request the UN to:

We urge the Special Rapporteurs on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Women, Torture, Child Protection, on Violence against Children and for Children and Armed Conflict, Human Rights Defenders and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues to urgently investigate the recent events with a view to making recommendations to provide protection and access to justice for the Marma sisters, Rani Yan Yan and women human rights defenders, reporting back to the United Nations at CEDAW and via the appropriate mechanisms.



We call on the international community, International financial institutions and donor countries such as the UK, Australia, USA, France and Canada, Japan (DfID, AusAID, USAid, CIDA, SIDA, NORAD, EU) to:

We ask supporters to stand in solidarity with the Marma sisters, Rani Yan Yan and other human rights defenders as they fight for justice and to hold their abusers and the institutions they represent to account for their actions.

There is too much wrong with this saleyard, with respect to the crumbling infrastructure, insufficient facilities and indifferent management. It's time to end this horror by closing down McDougall's saleyards.

On any day it is likely that you will witness animals stuffed into bags, frail bodies ripped from cages, and animals panting in relentless Queensland heat with no cooling or water. Animals crammed into tiny pens fight with other consignments while sick and injured animals are processed for sale against the rules.

Frightened and confused animals are abused at this dilapidated sale yard week after week. Cruelty and violence prevail. Our researchers have witnessed:

* Transportation violations* No water, even on scorching 39 degree days* No fans or insulation to protect animals from heat* Rough handling of birds likely resulting in broken bones* Starved, sick and injured animals being processed for sale* Animals suffering heat stress left untreated* Mixing of consignments leading to bullying and injury* Dangerous confinement systems that are not fit for purpose* Over-populated pens and cages

Queensland has adopted the Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals at saleyards, edition 31, as a mandatory code. This facility is guilty of multiple violations of the code.

1. There is no provision for spray cooling of pigs (section 5.1)2. Pigs are left in vehicles for extended periods of time (section 5.1)3. Pigs are placed in situations where fighting occurs with unfamiliar animals (section 5.1)4. Pigs are not provided with cool water at all times (section 5.1)5. Diseased, sick, injured and drought-stricken animals are ""processed"" contrary to section 1 of the code6. There are insufficient facilities to ensure that different consignments aren't mixed (section 3.3)7. Mature intact males are not separated from other animals (section 4.3)

Evidence depicts consistent and overt animal cruelty and a gross failure of duty of care. Evidence depicts consistent breaches of Animal Care & Protection Act objectives. We do not accept that it is possible for this saleyard to rectify this substantial number of problems.

We call on Queensland Minister for Agriculture Industry Development and Fisheries to stop this animal hell by closing the McDougall saleyard down immediately and stop forcing animals into this antiquated, inadequate and cruel facility."
350,Help us to fight shock eviction from residential care home for disabled adults.,,,Tony Galley,"Beckenham, ENG, United Kingdom",66458,"May 18, 2023",https://assets.change.org/photos/4/xb/rl/JdXbRLSyBILsUeP-800x450-noPad.jpg?1684435195,"Please help us today. We are the residents of the Queen Elizabeth Foundation’s Dorincourt care home in Leatherhead, Surrey, and have been told to leave our home by July 31.

The news came as a terrible shock to us, we are devastated, along with our families and friends. We have been told to vacate because the QEF want to sell our home to pay off a £2.6 million pensions deficit.

“It is very wrong, and we want the public to help us to stop the closure,” says Wendy, who has lived at Dorincourt for 32 years.

“We live as one big family. Why should Dorincourt be closed when there are other options the QEF could take.”

“I’m losing my friends and my home. Please stay open so that this nightmare will end,” says Matthew, 31, who has lived at Dorincourt for 11 years. “I have not found anywhere else to live yet and I am scared about my future.”

There are 38 of us adults living in the care home, many of us for years. We all have complex physical support and health needs; we use wheelchairs and require 24-hour care. Some of us also live with a learning disability.

We started this petition with our families and friends to save Dorincourt and to ask the QEF, which is a charity set up with the support of the Queen Mother in 1935, to reconsider its decision. Our campaign group, called “Save Dorincourt”, is convinced that our suggestion to sell the QEF’s headquarters at Leatherhead Court, which is for administrative staff, and move it to rented offices in the town centre, is the best option to pay off the £2.6 million pensions deficit.

We have also put forward a range of proposals to the QEF as solutions to the other reasons it has given us for the closure, namely, underfunding, a local authority payment shortfall, building refurbishments and staff shortages. We also want the charity to consider a bid from a potential a new owner who wants to keep it as a residential home rather than it be closed. We are convinced a solution can be found to keep us in our home.

The QEF said it would work with Surrey Adult Social Care and its brokerage team to find us new accommodation, but what they have offered us is not suitable. Most of us prefer to live in a large care home with long wide corridors as it means we can move around in our power chairs and wheelchairs independently, which gives us more access to places. But there are too few large residential care homes, with local authorities preferring much smaller ones, which are not suitable for all physically disabled people with additional needs. It is not “one size fits all”.

We are heartbroken at the thought of losing our home and splitting up our Dorincourt “family”. We are calling on the CEO and the Trustees of the QEF that run the home to reverse its decision and find a way to keep Dorincourt residential care home open.

Please help us. This could be your relative or friend. We ask you to sign our petition and help put pressure on the decision makers to find a solution to stop us from being forced to move. We can do this together.

Thank you so much."

Aged 7 he had improved so greatly that he was able to join the mainstream primary school his older brother also attended - this is where he truly flourished, the children there have all embraced him, and shown a level of friendship and care that always made my heart burst when I witnessed it - it was a small, caring community school which has gone above and beyond to nurture Malyn, if he hadn’t had those children and staff around him these last 4 yrs he wouldn’t have achieved all that he has to be part of our World and local community today.

Despite all this, his recent application for acceptance to attend the same High School as his brother and friends has been rejected - on the basis of his level of mental capacity to achieve academically, rather than the emotional and mental well-being of continuing to stay supported by his friends and brother.

I have been told by certain ‘professionals’ involved in his application and transition that as the High School applied for is renowned for its ‘high achievers’ then perhaps I should be looking at schools with units in them where ‘these children can go’. Malyn has a voice, and wants to go to the same school as his brother and friends. He has rights, for me his emotional and mental well-being far outweighs acedemic achievement. Yes, it wouldn’t be easy, the school would have to ‘think outside the box’ and tailor his curriculum and timetable to his abilities and needs. I keep asking myself, if he was in a wheelchair would they have rejected him? I would like to think not, they would tailor his activities in lessons to his needs - so why are they allowed to discriminate and reject a child who has an impairment of the brain?

We have another review meeting coming up this week and the appeal hoops to jump through, and we would love it if you could help Malyn by being a voice for him, to speak up for the rights of disabled children who can’t speak up for themselves, and fight for Autistic children to be embraced by our community for ALL of their school life, the right to have friends, the right to be included NOT excluded.

All of our children this past year have experienced the emotional trauma of being separated from their friends and school community, felt isolated and alone, in putting your name and support to this petition you can be part of fighting for Malyns right to not be excluded from his community and friends, a year of isolation has been enough for all of our children, but being prevented from progressing into High School with his brother and friends will only result in yet more, potentially life long isolation for Malyn from the community that has so far nurtured him so tenderly.

Please be part of our appeal today, by voicing your support for Malyns basic human rights to Inclusion, friendship, community care, education and acceptance. thank you! x"

Because of my disability, I cannot support or bear the weight of any part of my body. One of the most unnecessary challenges I face is travelling on planes. I think it’s time airlines stopped making air travel so demeaning and difficult for people with disabilities.

I use an electric wheelchair that is specifically designed to support my full body weight, to ensure my safety and comfort. I cannot use the regular wheelchairs offered by airlines as they aren’t equipped to fully support me. I need to stay in my motorised wheelchair until the last possible moment. Australian airlines need to step up and allow dignified air travel for people with disability. Special motorised wheelchairs must be made available.

My air travel experiences have been undignified and have compromised my safety. In the past, I have been lifted from my chair by a hydraulic lift while my carer precariously supports me. My carer has to carry me to my designated seat which is usually a fair way down the plane. It is awkward, demeaning and dangerous. Not only is it an OHS issue for my carer, but also unsafe for me to have my complete bodyweight on one person. Besides, it is absolutely inappropriate that a grown man like me is subjected to this degradation when instead airlines can start providing special motorised wheelchairs to support us.

To continue the spectacle, planes don’t have the capacity to store my chair because of its non-standard dimensions and weight. It is 2022 and people with disability are still not treated with the care and respect we deserve. Airlines need to assign special space for any such equipment that people with disability may necessarily carry.

I am hoping eventually that laws may change in relation to travelling in an electric wheelchair and that one day I may be able to sit in my own chair on an aeroplane similar to what is currently allowed in a vehicle. I know that America is considering such options, and hopefully, other countries will follow.

The death of a 12-year-old student, Sylvester Oromoni, of Dowen College, Lekki, Lagos, sparked outrage online when it was learned that he was allegedly bullied and beaten to death by other students at the boarding school. A viral video shared by the family has shown how Sylvester was writhing in pain while bleeding from his mouth. His lips appeared swollen and his teeth looked broken.

According to one of his relatives, the deceased mentioned the names of five persons, whom he said were allegedly responsible for his injuries before he finally died on Tuesday 30.11.2021.

In its response the student’s death, the Dowen College school’s authorities in a statement claimed the deceased sustained injuries while playing football and was given immediate medical attention by the school's resident nurse. The school denied that Sylvester had been bullied or attacked by some students in the school and said it had carried out a preliminary investigation, where it’s officials claimed that there was no case of bullying, adding that it has policies that are strongly anti-cultism.

The deceased, according to his parents in media reports had also alleged that he was given a substance to drink by the 'bullies'.

The efforts by the school’s administrators are not enough and authorities are silent. Investigations must be done to discover what really happened to Sylvester.

1. Did the school do enough to protect Sylvester? 2. How were the injuries that led to his death sustained?3. Was the school negligent in protecting its students?

There are so many questions and not enough answers.

We need the police to act immediately and investigate the circumstances and events that led to his death. We’re asking the Lagos Commissioner for Education, Folashade Adefisayo and officials of the Lagos State Universal Education Board, and the Federal Ministry of Education to probe allegations of bullying and negligence?

We’re asking for a thorough and transparent investigation and prosecution of those found to be culpable in this tragic incident.

Social protection is particularly important for children, in view of this crime, we also throw in our concern for children with disabilities to ensure the protection of children is inclusive of them.

Justice must be served and seen to be served for 12 year old Sylvester and his family.

364,Local Scientist Faces Racial Discrimination at Fitness Center,"My name is Dr. Vinit Sharma and I am a Computational Scientist at UT/ORNL Joint Institute for Computational Sciences, Oak Ridge National Lab, Oak Ridge, TN.
It’s been over 8 years since I moved to the United States. For all these years, I kept growing my awareness and appreciation of cross-cultural, cross-continental understanding continually . As a student, researcher, mentor, teacher, collaborator, I worked with a diverse population and learnt to be accepting of others and respect not only individuals but also the views of each and every individual regardless of race, gender, disability. I believe that working/interacting with diverse individuals is helpful not only for the individual, but for the institution and for overall society.
Knoxville prides itself on having a diverse population from more than 100 countries and I never ever thought I would experience what I recently did.
On Wednesday (Feb. 12th, 2020), for the first time in my 8 years of living in the United states I was the victim of a hate incident at a place which also entertains a diverse population a “Health and fitness club”. The name of the facility is Fort Sanders Health & Fitness Center in Knoxville, TN.
I believe a fitness club is the place where you can find diversity in all aspects. Moreover, It’s the place where most of the visitors spent at least 1-2 hours on a daily basis.
That evening as always I entered the health club and before starting my routine work out, I kept my few belongings on a bench. A gentleman was already sitting on the same bench. As soon as I placed my belongings on one corner of the bench, this person threw my phone, keys and other stuff on the floor. When I saw my stuff on the floor, I tried to talk to him. My intention was to know why he did this. I found this person in locker room. As soon as he saw me, he started saying, “I did that to you. you people deserve that” he started abusing me; mother *******, sand n*****, son of a ***** and calling me names. His remark was “you know you are minority”. He was so angry that could have harmed me. As He started approaching me I was concerned for my safety and at that point I asked him that we talk to the facility manager.
I immediately contacted the front desk and reported this incident to the shift supervisor. The Supervisor called the security. Security went to look for this guy with me in the locker room, but he was not there. When we came back to lobby, people who witnessed this incident told the supervisor about this guy. The supervisor confirmed that she had identified the person. She asked me to leave my contact information and said someone will get back to me. I left but couldn’t control my emotions. I felt like crying (actually I did cry) and came home.
Honestly, I couldn’t sleep that night. Next day, first thing in the morning I went to the health club to report this incidence to the manager. The response I got from him was shocking at the same time is was very disappointing. I explained the incident to him and mentioned that honestly, after this incident I don’t feel like coming here again. He said he is sorry about the incident and will get back to me by evening or within 24 hours. Finally, when I was leaving, he asked “Are you planning to come back?”. I was surprised with this question and when I understood his concerns, I told him “If you see this as a solution I will stop coming here, but I will let other people know about this”. “We have 11,000 members”, he said. By this time, I was at the door of his office, I turned around and came back. All I wanted was for them to issue a strong statement condemning the incident. But that request was falling on deaf ears.
It’s been almost 48 hours, since this incident occurred and I am still shaking inside & out.This is serious, not because this happened to me. But this can happen to anyone who looks different. To feel the threat, you don’t need to experience it most of the times, just watching such situations unfold can do the damage. Specially in a place where individuals of all age groups including old people, kids, pregnant ladies are present. These kinds of incidents can be traumatizing for everyone.
I used to read about similar incidents and used to think “the world is full of nice, humble, caring people” why one should care about these people. You encounter them once in a while, most of the time for not more than 5-10 minutes. Compare to good people around you these are very few in count. But a personal encounter to the situation was a different experience all together. Now I know how it feels. These 5 -10 minutes can make a big difference. It’s very difficult to find the words to express my emotions. I am asking that you join me to call of action. Through this entire incidence what has been the most discouraging is the way the management at the fitness center have handled the situation. My requests to the Fort Sanders management are as follows:
* Issue a strong statement condemning the incident that occurred on Wednesday February 12 at the health club. Statement to be circulated to the entire membership to assure all members that the health club welcomes all individuals irrespective of their ethnicity, race, culture, sexual orientation or religion.
* Include language in their new membership contract that any acts of discrimination based on ethnicity, race, culture, sexual orientation or religion will not be tolerated at the health club and serious actions will be taken against any individual exhibiting discriminatory behavior towards other members.
Please make your voices heard by signing this petition so the management team at Fort Sanders Heath and Fitness club hears us loud and clear that acts as such will not be tolerated in our community.

She’d never hurt a soul, and in fact risked her life and safety to protect her family, but she was held like a prisoner.

Help me shut down the detention center that mistreated and retaliated against my mother and other asylum-seekers. Sign if you want the Don T Hutto Detention Center shut down for good.

Many of the women being held in the center are seeking asylum from unthinkable violence in their home countries. My mother made the treacherous journey north to escape a violent gang and an abusive ex-husband who had tried to kill her multiple times. Another time, my mother missed an important immigration appointment to save my life, driving through the night to get us away from my husband, who had threatened to kill me.

Almost all of the women detained in Hutto have similar horror stories, but instead of being offered shelter in the U.S. they are being held in a facility that is not equipped to humanely house anyone. It’s time to shut down Hutto.

The Hutto Detention Center used to hold migrant children, but the conditions of the facility were so inhumane that intense public pressure forced it to close down. Children in the facility were forced to wear prison clothing, couldn’t have toys in their cells and were disciplined for acting like any other child – running, or talking too loudly. Now that the facility has reopened to detain women asylum-seekers, residents still have very limited medical care, no privacy and terrible food. There have been multiple allegations of sexual abuse and assault of women detainees at the hands of detention guards.

After months living in Hutto, my mother and hundreds of women couldn’t take it anymore and launched a hunger strike to protest the poor conditions at the facility. For their actions they faced retaliation: many people were sent to solitary confinement or transferred to other detention centers.

But she’s not giving up, and neither am I. Sign to stand with us and demand that the Department of Homeland Security shut down the Don T Hutto Detention Center."

This law imposes a ""time limit trick"" that will eradicate the rights and cultures of indigenous peoples from Brazilian history.

Why it matters: The removal of land from the humans who have been guardians of this forest creates unprecedented human rights violations and threatens the very existence of this biodiverse ecosystem that is supporting an habitable planet for us all. This law essentially is a declaration of war against nature and humanity, threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of indigenous peoples.

This bill was approved by a majority in the Federal Congress on Tuesday May 30th, and will now be reviewed by the Federal Senate. The Federal Supreme Court is bound to judge the constitutional legality of this “time limit trick” on Tuesday June 7th, creating an URGENT TIMELINE.

Who we are: We are a group of indigenous leaders and non-indigenous allies joining our voices to demand URGENT justice for the indigenous peoples of Brazil. We are aligned with leaders from across the Amazon Basin to ask the people of the world to mobilize their efforts to stop a historic injustice being committed against the indigenous peoples of Brazil.

OPEN LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT, THE FEDERAL CONGRESS, THE FEDERAL SENATE AND THE FEDERAL SUPREME COURT OF BRAZIL TO PROTECT THE TERRITORIAL RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AS A TOP PRIORITY FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND THE GLOBAL CLIMATE(Portuguese abaixo.)

28 May 2023

To the President,To the Federal Congress,To the Federal Senate,To the Federal Supreme Court,

As citizens from all over the world, we are uniting our voices to demand urgent justice for the indigenous peoples of Brazil. We reinforce the cry of indigenous leaders from all over the Amazon Basin and beyond, and ask you to mobilize all the efforts within your power to prevent a historic injustice being committed by the House of Representatives against the indigenous peoples of Brazil. We refer to the upcoming voting of Bill 490/2007 and its appendices.

As humanity is facing unprecedented challenges in terms of global climate change, biodiversity loss, species extinction, water scarcity, and tropical deforestation, Brazil’s leadership and responsibility needs to be an example along with the international community. There are no moral, ethical, political, economic, social or cultural grounds on which the proposed bill can find justification in the world of today.

The said bills are a death sentence to the indigenous peoples of Brazil and constitute a deliberate attack to the territorial, physical, and cultural integrity of the original inhabitants of your country, including their natural environment and resources in the name of “progress”. They intend to i) transfer the competence for the demarcation of Indigenous Lands from the Executive Power to the Legislative Power; ii) transform into Law the thesis of the temporal milestone, with the objective of making the demarcations of Indigenous Lands unviable; iii) allow the construction of highways, hydroelectric plants and other works in Indigenous Lands, without free, prior and informed consultation of the affected communities; iv) authorize anyone to question demarcation procedures of indigenous lands in all phases of the process, including those lands already homologated, causing legal insecurity; v) recognizing the legitimacy of titles, possessions and dominions over areas of traditional occupation, favoring the appropriation of indigenous lands for business interests; vi) reviving the dictatorial paradigms in the Brazilian legal regime that were overcome by the Federal Constitution of 1988, such as the tutelary regime and assimilationism, which aim to acculturate Indigenous Peoples, denying them the Right to Identity vii) making Indigenous Peoples in voluntary isolation more vulnerable to contact through flexibilizing indigenous policy ; viii) reformulating fundamental constitutional concepts of indigenous policy, such as traditional occupation, originary rights, and exclusive rights of usage.

In sum, we are witnessing the pavement of a road that will lead to environmental destruction, and unprecedented human rights violations.

This set of setbacks represents the continuity of the process of violence and usurpation of indigenous territories that has been reproduced in Brazil for more than 500 years. Instead of promoting legal security and peace in the countryside, PL 490 revokes the constitutional rights of indigenous peoples, especially the recognition of their secularly occupied lands and their self-determination.

Of the approximately 1,300 indigenous lands demanded by indigenous peoples, according to a survey by the Indigenous Missionary Council, more than 64% are still awaiting regularization. Furthermore, according to a report by the Pastoral Land Commission, of the 47 murders that occurred in rural areas in 2022, 38% were of indigenous peoples.

Indigenous peoples are holders of vast knowledge - deep and complex, historically developed knowledge, concerning the preservation of nature and the intelligent and careful use of biodiversity. Their stewardship over their lands, lives, cultures and knowledge constitutes an important source of inspiration and teaching for the global community in terms of how to live in peace with nature and one another. Their legal protection resides in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples (which praised the fundamental rights of indigenous peoples as original peoples), the Convention on Biological Diversity (which recognized the dependence of biological resources to indigenous populations), the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity (seeking the recognition of cultural diversity and the protection of minorities), the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (dealing with bioethical issues and protection of the vulnerable), and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

In Brazil, the Federal Constitution of 1988 recognized the pluriethnicity of the Brazilian state, in its articles 215 and 231, making it mandatory to apply the provisions in the protection of the rights of diverse ethnic groups, guaranteeing to all the full exercise of cultural rights and access to the sources of national culture, supporting and encouraging the appreciation and dissemination of cultural manifestations.

In this sense, honourable Members of Parliament and Senate, we ask you to help defend the inalienable rights of the indigenous peoples that are inscribed in international legislation and the Magna Carta of Brazil, and to grant your vote against the approval of PL 490. Thousands of indigenous children and young people depend on you to be able to live in peace in their communities, learning their traditions from their parents and elders, and developing their full potential as human beings on this planet.

Your vote is essential to ensure that indigenous peoples can continue to exist and enrich the social, cultural and economic fabric of Brazil, and the global community, through their traditions, languages, spirituality, knowledge, technologies, and the environmental services they provide to all of us, with the preservation of nature.

We also call for the urgent sensibilization of the President and the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil for the upholding of the constitutional and international rights of indigenous peoples. The global community is watching and we trust that order and progress can be accompanied with love.

We trust that you can find in your hearts the decision to stand with the indigenous peoples of Brazil and stand in solidarity with the millions of people around the world that carry deep admiration for the leadership of Brazil in promoting a sustainable development that benefits its population and the world.

In solidarity and respect.

CARTA ABERTA AO PRESIDENTE, CONGRESSO FEDERAL, SENADO FEDERAL, E O SUPREMO TRIBUNAL FEDERAL DO BRASIL PARA PROTEGER OS DIREITOS TERRITORIAIS DOS POVOS INDÍGENAS COMO PRIORIDADE MÁXIMA PARA A JUSTIÇA SOCIAL E O CLIMA GLOBAL

29 DE MAIO DE 2023

Ao Presidente,Ao Congresso Federal,Ao Senado Federal,Ao Supremo Tribunal Federal,

Como cidadãos do mundo inteiro, estamos unindo nossas vozes para exigir justiça urgente para os povos indígenas do Brasil. Reforçamos o clamor dos líderes indígenas de toda a Bacia Amazônica e além, e pedimos que mobilizem todos os esforços ao seu alcance para impedir que uma injustiça histórica seja cometida pela Câmara dos Deputados contra os povos indígenas do Brasil. Referimo-nos à aprovação do Projeto de Lei 490/2007 e seus anexos.

Enquanto a humanidade enfrenta desafios sem precedentes em termos de mudanças climáticas globais, perdas de biodiversidade, extinções de espécies, escassez de água e o desmatamento tropical, a liderança e a responsabilidade do Brasil precisam ser um exemplo em conjunto com a comunidade internacional. Não há fundamentos morais, éticos, políticos, econômicos, sociais ou culturais que justifiquem o projeto de lei proposto no mundo atual.

Os referidos projetos de lei são uma sentença de morte para os povos indígenas do Brasil e constituem um ataque deliberado à integridade territorial, física e cultural dos habitantes originais de seu país, incluindo seu ambiente e recursos naturais, em nome do ""progresso"". Pretendem i) transferir a competência para a demarcação de Terras Indígenas do Poder Executivo para o Poder Legislativo; ii) transformar em Lei a tese do marco temporal, com o objetivo de inviabilizar as demarcações de Terras Indígenas; iii) permitir a construção de rodovias, usinas hidrelétricas e outras obras em Terras Indígenas, sem consulta livre, prévia e informada às comunidades afetadas; iv) autorizar qualquer pessoa a questionar os procedimentos de demarcação de terras indígenas em todas as fases do processo, inclusive aquelas terras já homologadas, causando insegurança jurídica; v) reconhecer a legitimidade de títulos, posses e domínios sobre áreas de ocupação tradicional, favorecendo a apropriação de terras indígenas para interesses empresariais; vi) retomada dos paradigmas ditatoriais do regime jurídico brasileiro superados pela Constituição Federal de 1988, como o regime tutelar e o assimilacionismo, que visam à aculturação dos povos indígenas, o que lhes nega o direito à identidade; vii) tornar os povos indígenas em isolamento voluntário mais vulneráveis ao contato por meio da flexibilização da política indigenista; viii) reformulação de conceitos constitucionais fundamentais da política indigenista, como ocupação tradicional, direitos originários e direitos exclusivos de usufruto.

Resumindo, estamos testemunhando a pavimentação de uma estrada que levará à destruição ambiental e a violações de direitos humanos nunca vistas antes.

Esse conjunto de retrocessos representa a continuidade do processo de violência e usurpação dos territórios indígenas que vem se reproduzindo no Brasil há mais de 500 anos. Em vez de promover a segurança jurídica e a paz no campo, o PL 490 revoga os direitos constitucionais dos povos indígenas, especialmente o reconhecimento de suas terras secularmente ocupadas e sua autodeterminação.

Das cerca de 1.300 terras indígenas reivindicadas pelos povos indígenas, de acordo com uma pesquisa do Conselho Indigenista Missionário, mais de 64% ainda estão aguardando sua regularização. Além disso, de acordo com um relatório da Comissão Pastoral da Terra, dos 47 assassinatos ocorridos em áreas rurais em 2022, 38% eram de povos indígenas.

Os povos indígenas são detentores de um vasto conhecimento - profundo e complexo, historicamente desenvolvido - sobre a preservação da natureza e o uso inteligente e cuidadoso da biodiversidade. A administração de suas terras, vidas, culturas e conhecimentos constitui uma fonte importante de inspiração e ensinamento para a comunidade global em termos de como viver em paz com a natureza e uns com os outros. Sua proteção legal está na Declaração Universal dos Direitos Humanos, na Convenção Americana sobre Direitos Humanos, na Convenção 169 sobre Povos Indígenas e Tribais (que enalteceu os direitos fundamentais dos povos indígenas como povos originários), na Convenção sobre Diversidade Biológica (que reconheceu a dependência dos recursos biológicos para as populações indígenas), a Declaração Universal sobre a Diversidade Cultural (que busca o reconhecimento da diversidade cultural e a proteção das minorias), a Convenção para a Salvaguarda do Patrimônio Cultural Imaterial (que trata de questões bioéticas e da proteção dos mais vulneráveis) e a Declaração das Nações Unidas sobre os Direitos dos Povos Indígenas.

No Brasil, a Constituição Federal de 1988 reconheceu a plurietnicidade do Estado brasileiro, em seus artigos 215 e 231, tornando obrigatória a aplicação dos dispositivos na proteção dos direitos dos diversos grupos étnicos, garantindo a todos o pleno exercício dos direitos culturais e o acesso às fontes da cultura nacional, apoiando e incentivando a valorização e a difusão das manifestações culturais.

Nesse sentido, ilustres deputados e senadores, pedimos que ajudem a defender os direitos inalienáveis dos povos indígenas, inscritos na legislação internacional e na Carta Magna do Brasil, e que deem seu voto contra a aprovação do PL 490. Milhares de crianças e jovens indígenas dependem de vocês para poderem viver em paz em suas comunidades, aprendendo sobre suas tradições com seus pais e anciãos e desenvolvendo todo o seu potencial como seres humanos neste planeta.

Seu voto é essencial para garantir que os povos indígenas possam continuar a existir e enriquecer o tecido social, cultural e econômico do Brasil e da comunidade global, por meio de suas tradições, línguas, espiritualidade, conhecimentos, tecnologias e serviços ambientais que prestam para todos nós, preservando a natureza.

Também pedimos a sensibilização urgente do Presidente e o Supremo Tribunal Federal do Brasil para a defesa dos direitos constitucionais e internacionais dos povos indígenas. A comunidade global está observando e confiamos que a ordem e o progresso podem ser acompanhados com amor.

Confiamos que vocês possam encontrar em seus corações a decisão de apoiar os povos indígenas do Brasil e se solidarizar com milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo que têm profunda admiração pela liderança do Brasil na promoção de um desenvolvimento sustentável que beneficie a sua população e o mundo.

2. Il fenomeno della globalizzazione, la complessità delle problematiche mondiali – prime fra tutte il “cambiamento climatico” e il “degrado ambientale” – richiedono il costituirsi di un’indispensabile “coscienza planetaria”.

3. L’“etica di guerra” – giustificata spesso per gli interessi dello Stato-Nazione – è oggi superata dall’interconnessione economico/commerciale e dall’imprescindibile cooperazione fra tutti i popoli e tutti i continenti, specie nell’ambito della ricerca scientifica e delle innovazioni tecnologiche, volte a contrastare il surriscaldamento ambientale e la fame.

4. La lotta è necessaria ma non più fra blocchi di Stati, ancorati alla vecchia logica, residuo anacronistico delle due guerre mondiali, ma per salvaguardare le risorse e le bellezze della nostra Terra, per garantire alla future generazioni vivibilità e felicità.

5. La politica – sia sul piano territoriale sia su quello mondiale – deve promuovere un’educazione al rispetto e alla cooperazione tra persone e popoli, nella consapevolezza che solo da questo ne possano trovare giovamento tutti.

6. Alla base formativa dei bambini e dei giovani diventa necessaria un’organizzazione reticolare della conoscenza, generando un “apprendimento collaborativo”, attraverso il quale bambini/e e giovani possano condividere pensieri e sentimenti con gli altri, per un superiore bene comune, di cui la pace fra i popoli ne è una condizione.

7. Tutto ciò è volto a produrre una “politica della biosfera”, volta a mettere in connessione tutti gli esseri umani – oggi possibile con Internet - facendoli percepire come un unico organismo vivente.

8. I programmi di educazione mondiali devono rendere indispensabile una “empatia globale”, capace di creare una “coscienza biosferica”.

9. Solo considerando la nostra madre Terra come un imprescindibile “bene comune”, potremo intervenire in maniera efficace per la salvaguardia del nostro pianeta, impegnando tutte le forze socio-culturali, la ricerca scientifica e la produzione tecnologica per un’evoluzione etica, volta al benessere materiale e spirituale per tutta l’umanità.

10. La logica della guerra non può che essere sostituita dalla logica della cooperazione.

Il nostro intento - con questo messaggio - è quello di far riflettere tutti i  governanti sul fatto che le guerre sono assolutamente non convenienti e contrastanti con l’interesse delle singole nazioni, in quanto tutte parti di una unità globale, ormai interconnessa a livello economico, sociale e spirituale.

La sensibilizzazione delle popolazioni e la pressione sui governi sono fondamentali, per conseguire questo obiettivo epocale, che è ormai vitale per il nostro pianeta Terra.

A new planetary politics for an ethics of cooperation

1. Faced with planetary problems, there is a need for a ""new ethics"" - beyond the different cultures and religions - inspiring a ""new world politics"".

2. The phenomenon of globalization, the complexity of world problems - first of all ""climate change"" and ""environmental degradation"" - require the establishment of an indispensable ""planetary consciousness"".

3. The ""ethics of war"" - often justified for the interests of the Nation-State - is today overcome by the economic / commercial interconnection and by the essential cooperation between all peoples and all continents, especially in the field of scientific research and technological innovations, aimed at combating environmental overheating and hunger.

4. The fight is necessary but no longer between blocks of states, anchored to the old logic, anachronistic residue of the two world wars, but to safeguard the resources and beauties of our Earth, to guarantee livability and happiness for future generations.

5. Politics - both on a territorial and a global level - must promote education in respect and cooperation between people and peoples, in the awareness that this is the only way to benefit everyone.

6. At the educational basis of children and young people, a networked organization of knowledge becomes necessary, generating a ""collaborative learning"", through which children and young people can share thoughts and feelings with others, for a greater common good, of which peace among peoples is a condition of this.

7. All this is aimed at producing a “politics of the biosphere”, aimed at connecting all human beings - now possible with the Internet - making them perceive as a single living organism.

8. World education programs must make a ""global empathy"" indispensable, capable of creating a ""biospheric consciousness"".

9. Only by considering our mother Earth as an essential ""common good"", will we be able to intervene effectively for the protection of our planet, engaging all socio-cultural forces, scientific research and technological production for an ethical evolution, once to material and spiritual well-being for all humanity.

10 The logic of war can only be replaced by the logic of cooperation.

Our intent - with this message - is to make all rulers reflect on the fact that wars are absolutely inconvenient and in contrast with the interest of individual nations, as they are all parts of a global unity, now interconnected at an economic level, social and spiritual.

The awareness of the populations and the pressure on governments are fundamental to achieve this epochal goal, which is now vital for our planet Earth.

In 1980 it was 9 per cent.

The Canadian government has started a plan to help these women’s lives safer however they have delayed it and are ignoring calls to fast track it. The US government has also got a similar plan however not much seems to be happening. These women deserve justice and shouldn’t be forgotten. Use your voice to speak up for those who can’t!

From sexting to widespread access to porn - the school environment has changed. But education has not changed with it. As long ago as early 2013, my heart broke as I read a 13-year old girl’s story, which she had shared with the Everyday Sexism Project. She wrote that she was so scared to have sex she would cry nearly every night. A boy at school had shown her a video on his mobile phone, and she didn’t understand why “the real life sex that we see is so scary and painful and the woman is crying and getting hurt.”

She went on: “I try to think don't worry you won’t have to do it for ages but everyone at school keeps acting like it’s normal and we’re meant to do it really soon like some of the boys keep asking me have I done it and can I do it with them and showing me the horrible pictures and things.”

Since then, the problem has got worse not better, yet, still the government resists making sex and relationships education a formal part of the curriculum.

That 13-year old is just one of thousands of young people who are confused and misinformed by what they see in online pornography. At one school I visited, teachers were dealing with a rape case involving a 14-year old boy. A teacher asked him: “why didn’t you stop when she was crying?” He replied: “Because it’s normal for girls to cry during sex.”

Young people are bombarded with confusing and often misogynistic messages from the world around them -- 60% have seen online porn by the age of 14. Teenage girls are getting pressured into having sex, and a recent BBC Freedom of Information request revealed that 5,500 sexual offences, including 600 rapes, were reported to police as having taken place in schools over a 3-year period. That’s almost exactly one rape per school day.

This is why we need compulsory sex and relationships education (SRE). It’s a scandal that our schools do not equip young people with the skills they need to understand consent, healthy relationships, LGBT rights and relationships, gender stereotypes and online pornography.While some parents may speak to their children about these issues individually, not all will, and sadly some children will already be experiencing sexual abuse outside the classroom. We owe every child clear, age-appropriate information, so they can understand that abuse isn’t normal, and learn how to navigate healthy relationships.

It’s too important to leave to chance.

This slash in funding will undoubtedly make this the biggest reform in the education system in a long time. Some of the changes that are to be made include the following:

• Cutting OSAP for university students

• Getting rid of specialty programs for at-risk students or those with autism and other disabilities

• Increasing the maximum capacity for classrooms (from 22 to over 30 students)

• 4 compulsory online courses must be taken

• Banning cell phones in the classroom

So why does this matter?

The Ford government’s drastic plan affects students and teachers in every way. Students will face more challenges when learning, especially with the increase of class sizes. Similarly, teachers will struggle to meet the needs of every student. That is besides the fact that some 10,000 teaching positions in the province will disappear.

These transformations will only push us back and the repercussions are not being considered. We must unite against leaders that are jeopardizing our province’s development. Why should these individuals dictate the success of so many Ontarians?

Das Internet wächst und wächst und nimmt somit einen immer größeren Teil unseres Lebens ein. Ein Grund für dieses Wachstum waren anfänglich die zahlreichen Möglichkeiten und die FREIHEIT, die das Internet geboten hat. Der Online-Handel nimmt unterdessen einen hohen Stellenwert in unserer Wirtschaft ein.

Am Anfang - der heute großen Internetseiten - stand eine gute Idee, die der Grundstein für den Erfolg vieler Konzerne war. Mit dem Einfluss von Investoren haben sich diese Ideen allerdings verändert.

INTERNET HEUTE

Das heutige Internet gefährdet:

Näheres hierzu unter: https://apoos.de/kritik-am-internet/

DIE MACHT

Die Marktmacht des Internets liegt in der Hand von wenigen US-Internetkonzernen. Diese generieren bereits jetzt einen Umsatz von mehreren hundert Milliarden US-Dollar jährlich. Einige von Ihnen haben sogar Barreserven von über 100 Milliarden US-Dollar.

Wie man einer Anhörung vor dem US Kongress entnehmen durfte, scheinen diese Konzerne aber noch nicht genug zu haben:

https://1e9.community/t/so-sollen-amazon-apple-facebook-und-google-ihre-marktmacht-gegen-konkurrenten-eingesetzt-haben/5056

Ich habe sonst auch hier noch eine Video dazu gemacht:

https://youtu.be/2QRY8zhrm0U

Nutzer unter Handlungszwang!

Egal in welchem Bereich Sie tätig sind, wenn eine Suchmaschine Ihre Seite und somit Ihr Produktangebot abwertet, werden Sie weniger Umsatz machen. Liegt Ihr Schwerpunkt im Online-Bereich oder Online-Handel kann dies Existenzbedrohend sein. Sie haben somit zumindest theoretisch zwei Möglichkeiten, die erste Sie verzichten auf den Umsatz, wenn Sie es sich leisten können. Die zweite Möglichkeit ist, Sie kaufen sich Ihre Sichtbarkeit zurück mit Hilfe von Anzeigenprogrammen die Suchmaschinen oder Sozialen Netzwerke anbieten.

Vor einigen Jahren hätte man gesagt, die paar Cent pro Klick sind ja nicht schlimm. Heute sind aus den paar Cent jedoch in vielen Bereichen einige EURO pro Klick geworden. Natürlich kann man diese Kosten dann wieder auf den Verbraucher umlegen, aber was bedeutet das eigentlich?

Ein(e) Unternehmen / Suchmaschine / Social Community hat aufgrund seiner Marktmacht (zu wenig Konkurrenz) die Möglichkeit den Preis für das Überleben eines Unternehmens nicht nur zu bestimmen, sondern diese auch zu vernichten, z.B. in dem das betroffene Unternehmen keine Werbung schalten darf oder die Preise entsprechend hoch sind. Eine Transparenz ist aus meiner Sicht hier nicht zu erkennen.

Es kommt noch schlimmer

Eine US Suchmaschine bringt nach und nach eigene Produktbereiche auf den Markt und entzieht der deutschen Wirtschaft damit quasi die lukrativen Geschäftsbereiche und stärkt damit weiter seine Machtposition und Gewinne.

Strafen keine Lösung

Natürlich gibt es die Bundesregierung oder die EU, die dann ab und an angebliche Rekordstrafen verhängen, wer sich mit diesem Thema näher beschäftigt wird schnell feststellen, das sich selbst in Deutschland die Bildung von Kartellen finanziell bezahlt macht und das auch, wenn man erwischt wird.

Eine große Suchmaschine, die auch ein Betriebsprogramm für Handys auf den Markt gebracht hat, erhielt von der EU im Jahre 2018 eine Strafe in Höhe von 4,3 Milliarden EUR. Das mag auf Anhieb viel erscheinen, teilt man die Summe jedoch durch die Anzahl der ausgelieferten Betriebssysteme und der bereits vergangenen Jahre, ergibt dies einen Wert, der gerade zu lächerlich klein ist, insbesondere im Vergleich zu den vermutlichen Werbeeinnahmen, die mit dem Betriebssystem in diesem Zeitraum erzielt wurden.

Eine Milliarde EURO und mehr verdienen einige Suchmaschinen oder Social Communities in nur einem Monat. Mit einem solchen Finanzpolster kann man sich sowohl rechtlich als auch technisch allerhand einfallen lassen, um die Nutzer noch stärker an sich zu binden.

ZUKUNFT

Was bringt die Zukunft? Wenn sich die aktuelle Situation nicht ändert, werden diese Konzerne weiterhin jeden Betrag verlangen können! Wenn die Gier dieser Plattformen noch weiter steigt, sind nicht nur einzelne Arbeitsplätze oder Unternehmen gefährdet, sondern ganze Industriezweige! Mich persönlich macht das doch sehr nachdenklich.

LÖSUNGEN

MEIN ANTEIL

Ich selbst habe bereits zwei Anläufe gestartet (2008 & 2011 - 2017) eine entsprechende Plattform ins Leben zu rufen. Das Konzept für meine faire All-In-One Community bzw. Social Media & Marketing Plattform findest Du unter https://APOOS.de. Die ersten beiden Anläufe habe ich im Übrigen selbst finanziert, für den dritten Anlauf benötige ich finanzielle Unterstützung.

FORDERUNG DIESER PETITION

Zur Gleichstellung der Marktmacht und zur Reduzierung einer möglichen Gefährdung von Arbeitsplätzen und Unternehmen halte ich folgenden Punkt für sinnvoll:

I: Bereitstellung von Fördermitteln für das APOOS Projekt durch die EU oder die Bundesregierung.II: Prüfung und Umsetzung unseres Maßnahmenkatalogs.

Ist das Deine Meinung?

- Wir brauchen dringend mehr fairen Wettbewerb zum Schutz von Arbeitsplätzen- Zur Reduzierung von Manipulationen- und zur Reduzierung der Marktmacht der großen Internetkonzerne.

Dann unterstütze diese Petition.

He was denied temporary residence because people with disabilities are considered a burden on Australian society. I’m calling on the government to change migration laws so people with disabilities are treated fairly.

A temporary resident can’t even access services under Medicare, yet my son was denied his visa on grounds that he’ll be a burden on the health system. This is pure discrimination against people with disabilities. Nobody should be forced to leave the country or denied entry because of their health situation or disability.

I work as a nurse in Adelaide. Throughout the pandemic, I served as a frontline worker in an aged care centre. I consider Australia as my home and want to do everything I can to serve the society. But I’m heartbroken by the way Australia has treated my son.

I am forced to live separately from my wife and child because of the cruel laws that discriminate against people like my son. He’s completely independent in his daily activities and has good verbal communication but this shouldn’t determine whether or not he’s good enough to live in Australia.

It’s been hard on us as a family to live apart from each other. I hope to apply for a permanent residency for all of us again soon. I want the discriminatory law to change before that because nobody deserves to be treated this way.

I always thought that something must be wrong with youngsters who choose to take their lives, until I faced a similar situation in 2017 when I decided to take mine due to a spine injury that ended my career in the Armed Forces (National Defence Academy).

It wasn’t long before I went through Depression and PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). I found myself flailing in the ocean of helplessness and silence. Back in those days I thought I was the only one who was going through this, but when I looked around there were so many; some my age, some elder, but mostly younger.

I did some research only to find out that one student dies by suicide every hour in India, and one out of four students in 13-15 age group is depressed in India. India has the highest suicide rate among the ten South-East Asian Countries.

While there are a lot of conversations around mental health, breaking the stigma, and its importance among schoolchildren, the ground level reality is abysmal. Even the NEP 2020, and the Manodarpan Initiative by the Education Ministry has not addressed the issue sufficiently.

The ask of the petition is to incorporate Mandatory Mental Health Curriculum(non-graded) in all public and private schools.

What does a Mental Health Curriculum include?

The curriculum is not about adding more syllabus, but rather educating and sensitizing the students through dialogues, discussions, activities, feedbacks, exercises, skill training, etc. It’s high time that the trend of ‘observing’ a ‘mental health week/day’ in schools once a year changes to all-year round curriculum; or else it loses its effectiveness just like the sad state of ‘sex education’ in schools.

I urge you to sign this petition and play your part. The more people sign, the more momentum this campaign gains, increasing the chances of success. I cannot do this without you.

In support of this petition I just walked from Kanyakumari to Kashmir (4000 kms)  which began on 16th November 2020 and ended on 20th April. In my journey I met various government officials, making pit stops at schools, local government bodies, private institutions, and social activists, getting petition signatures, spreading awareness and taking this cause forward with maximum intensity.

We cannot bring this request into fruition without all the forces working together recognizing that mental health education in schools is need of the hour.

Sign my petition asking the Ministry of Education to incorporate Mandatory Mental Health Curriculum in Schools.

I need your help. Please sign this petition and ask everyone around you to do it too. Every signature matters; to us, and to the ones who are looking at us from the stars.

But not all. Children with serious illness will be left behind and in desperate need of home learning. As a nation, we don’t know how many children are affected, that is why I am asking you to sign this petition to ensure all children unable to attend school are recorded in a national dataset.

My son Sam was isolated for the last four years of his life until he died last November. He was diagnosed with leukemia at 8 years old and could no longer go to school. I had no idea what education Sam could have, or how disruption to learning would also tear away his connection to the outside world.

Learning for children like Sam is often forgotten. They are known as “invisible children” because there is no dataset to record them. And without it, authorities can’t allocate help, nor be held to account. That’s why I’m calling on Gavin Williamson to ensure that isolated children are correctly identified within the education system - so that they can access the educational experience to which they are entitled.

School is not just about teaching children English and Maths, it’s a place they foster friendships and learn key social skills for life.

The support available varies based on where you live and how proactive authorities are at keeping local records. It’s a postcode lottery. I had to push hard for Sam to get some education and although he received on average 3 hours a week of home tuition, he remained socially isolated from his whole school community.

Sam developed post-traumatic stress disorder which manifested into anxiety and OCD due to extended isolation. I believe that if more had been done from the outset to provide Sam with a full education with available technology, Sam’s mental health would not have deteriorated to such an extent.

After 3 years of limited tuition, Sam was loaned a robot (AV1) which he named Marvin. Marvin would be in class and Sam could control him remotely. It transformed Sam’s ability to participate in lessons and interact with his friends. To get Marvin allowed in class, we had to challenge the school and wait 7 months. No child should have to fight to be included in education.

Despite everything, Sam was tenacious and creative. He created a superhero cartoon “Bubbleboy” who was with him throughout his struggle. If Sam were here, I know he and Bubbleboy would be on a mission to make sure no child is left invisible. Now, I take this campaign forward in his memory.

In the pandemic, people saw a glimpse of what isolation is like. This is everyday life for some children.  Don’t leave these children behind. Please help by signing - so that no child is invisible.

This means that ISPs (Internet Service Providers) right now can track location, internet usage, financial records, and history. On top of the provocative changes already made, ISPs no longer have to alert one if a hacker has gained access to this data, so you never know who has control of your information thanks to the internet. Our goal is to stop and spread awareness of the potential safety hazards that it produces, as well as provide a solution. In order to target and solve this problem we urge Comcast, the largest ISP, to become a leader and example of good ISP practices by stopping the tracking or selling any and all consumer data.

We believe that the change in policy government has initiated is a breach of privacy, and not just or legal under the 14th amendment of the constitution. As for some it is near impossible to switch ISP’s, not to mention inability function without the internet in today’s world. According to Slate however, what makes it worse is the lack of protection the ISP’s put on our information once they have it, leaving it vulnerable to hackers and others who wish to use that information to harm us. As you can imagine, lack of protection of financial information as well as location and browsing history can lead to many unfortunate situations, the primary of which is blackmail. According to NPR, with this information now in the hands of the ISP’s there is very little we can do to protect ourselves. The natural question is then, what can we do? Seeing as this just passed congress, and given the current look of congress we believe there is no hope in fixing this on the federal level. So we must convince the ISP’s to not use the power they now have. We are specifically targeting Comcast, the current largest provider in the U.S. If we can convince the largest ISP that as consumers we will not stand for all of our information being tracked and sold, then we can create a market where choices are reasonable, and we will not be forced to worry about safety, privacy or security. However, just signing a petition is not enough, we are ask you to vote with your wallet and boycott Comcast until they agree to no longer track our information. This will start a world where we can all have our privacy and feel secure using the things we have to for work, school, and leisure."

Considering the importance of seafarers and the immigration challenges some of them face regardless of their qualifications and length of service, I believe it would help the maritime industry to engage in measures that ensure they are treated fairly and have access to similar immigration conditions as their counterparts in the course of their maritime duties.

I would like to use this medium to posit that the IMO discuss with member states to look into the immigration situation, so that all seafarers can have access to medical facilities in any port they find themselves as well as being able to disembark from ships on completion of contract and join ships for which they are assigned at any port, irrespective of nationality."

My name is Ernest Boateng; I am the husband of Mary Agyapong, the 28 year old pregnant nurse who tragically died in April, after becoming infected with Covid19. Since Mary’s death, very little has been done to protect pregnant women from this life threatening virus, despite studies showing that for those in the later stages of pregnancy, they are more likely to become severely unwell. That is why I am calling on the Government to protect pregnant women by ensuring they can either work from home, or they must be suspended from work on full pay.

The announcement of a vaccine which is to be rolled out imminently is good news for many people who are vulnerable, but pregnant women will not be given the vaccine. This means they will not be protected when other vulnerable people will be. The Government must consider the specific needs of pregnant women to ensure they are safe.

The guidance for pregnant women has been confusing throughout this pandemic. The current guidance continues to list pregnant women as vulnerable and says that if they cannot work from home then they should adhere to strict social distancing. But, we know that this is not happening. Research by Pregnant Then Screwed in October found that 57% of pregnant women who are working outside of the home do not feel safe, and only half of pregnant women (53%) have had a risk assessment from their employer, and even then, many employers are ignoring their own risk assessment. Only 1% of pregnant women who cannot work from home have been suspended from work on safety grounds.

The groups at increased risk of severe COVID-19 were recognised including the increased risk for mothers from Black, Asian and minority ethnic heritage.

An analysis of women in French hospitals showed that those in the second half of pregnancy, from 20 weeks gestation, were five times more likely to be admitted to ICU than those in the first half of pregnancy. We also know that maternal Covid-19 is associated with an approximately three times greater risk of preterm birth. Black pregnant women were 8 times more likely to be hospitalised than white pregnant women, according to research by Oxford University.

Mary should not have been working based on the facts and findings above. She was 35 weeks pregnant when she tested positive for Covid-19.

In memory of my beautiful, kind and caring wife, I ask that no other family has to experience what mine has. Please sign this petition to demand that all pregnant women are protected by ensuring they can either work from home or are suspended from work on full pay."

This is just the most recent example of the NFL’s persistent and serious problem with players committing violence against women. Of 32 teams, 21 have players that have been charged at some point with domestic or sexual violence.

What’s even more appalling is how the NFL chooses to punish players who commit these crimes. While Rice sits out of the first two games of the 2014 season his teammate, Will Hill, will be suspended for six games for marijuana use. In fact, the NFL consistently hands down stricter punishments for breaking the substance abuse policy than for committing violent crimes against female partners and acquaintances.

Comissioner Roger Goodell has acknowledged the NFL has a domestic violence problem and said it’s the responsibility of the NFL “to do some things to combat this problem.” One thing the NFL must do is establish consistent, mandatory disciplinary procedures for violations of the league’s ‘personal conduct policy’ similar to the mandatory minimum 4 game suspension players face if they violate the substance abuse policy.

When the NFL doesn’t take domestic violence seriously the league is sending a message to its players, its team owners, and its fans they shouldn’t either. The NFL is telling women, one in four of which will be a victim of domestic violence, that what happens to them, to quote Ravens head coach John Harbaugh when asked about Rice’s actions, is “not that big of a deal.”

If the NFL doesn't start taking violence against women seriously now, when will it ever? It’s time to hold the NFL accountable for what it does, not what its Commissioner and others say it will do.

Please join me in asking Commissioner Goodell to create consistent, mandatory disciplinary consequences for players who commit domestic violence and sexual assault."

Minister Dix had lifted parking fees at hospitals at the beginning of the pandemic - but reinstated them March 2022. His reason? He stated that ""non-hospital users are taking advantage of the situation to park for free while conducting business that is not hospital related.""

Instead of charging hundreds to health care workers why not provide them a staff parking pass for them to display in their car?

Not all of the health care facilities can be experiencing this problem, because many have parkades with fob or code access. Health Authorities are also charging their staff for parking when staff are on vacation, off sick, and working over-time.

ENGLISH

The State of Chile, Encourages the discrimination among its citizens:

Nowadays in Chile, only a 39,2% of the people with disabilities within the working age have a job. On average, they receive a salary 31,9% lower than the rest of the adults hired in the country.

This inequality is protected by the law.

The bill 18.600 on its 16th article, points out in a direct and clear fashion that:

“The working contract held by the individual with a mental disability, can provide a salary that is freely agreed among both parts, not applying in this regard, the regulations of the minimum wage”

This is a regulation with a strong sense of discrimination , that undermines the people with disabilities and encourages the abuse on behave of their employers, allowing them to work alike, but receiving less remuneration.

Currently, there is a debate at the congress about the implementation of a Quotas Law,  that seeks to ensure a place for the disabled, forcing the private and the public companies with more than 200 hundred worker, to at least have 1 % of employees with disabilities. In this context, and looking forward for a system that considers everyone as a productive potential, and not as a charity work, we ask the Senate and the Chamber of deputies of Chile to:

We believe that this may contribute to a more equal and just country, especially in regards of human rights, working rights and social integration, within people with disabilities.

An effective working integration goes beyond the sole procurement of a paid job, it is also a result of stability and personal development in equal conditions and opportunities."

Groups breaking up here and there - an odd person or two getting up, while hastily wrapping up the conversation. But not everyone seemed to be in a hurry to leave- only the girls, who were glancing nervously at their hostel. The girls at my institute were required to be back in their hostel by 10:30 pm, for reasons of 'safety'. The boys, from whom these girls were meant to be 'protected' had no curfew.

I learned about this rule on the first day of college. I accepted it, like all the women before me. We enter an institute or college straight after school with our hearts full of hope. We take a leap of faith:- ""We are starting a journey that will prepare us for the world beyond."" Our 17-year-old selves don't realise that the system we trust has built-in gender-biased rules.

In a cohort of 4 girls and 18 boys, I was usually the only girl in a group project. More often than not, I found myself making the presentation while the two boys worked in the design studio on the prototype late into the night. In bigger cohorts, girls made their own groups because boys did not want members who would be 'useless’ after 10:30 pm. The college administration had to resort to reserving seats for girls in organising teams for major college events because they were not being selected otherwise. Why should they be if they hadn’t spent nights planning and working the way boys had?

Students of these colleges will agree that the overall productivity of the college could be improved if the females had the opportunity to add it to it as well. They will also laugh at the irony of being asked to 'collaborate' with the 'other' sex when they were separated via biased rules and moral policing, all through their college lives.

Colleges and hostels are not changing their ways despite the issues their women students are facing. So I’m asking Infosys, one of the most coveted places to work in India, to stand up to colleges with sexist rules- like gender-discriminatory hostel curfews and gender-biased dress codes- by issuing a mandate for conducting placement drives.

Infosys is one of the mass recruiters at engineering college and if Infosys stands with us today, equality will matter to our institutes and will do away with authorising discrimination.

This could be a more comprehensive section of the existing board examination that includes the use of testing Free T3, Free T4, Reverse T3, thyroid antibodies along with TSH.  Endocrinologists should also be proficient in the use of thyroid treatment which includes the use of natural dessicated thyroid medication, T3-only medication, T4-only medication, as well as combination therapies.2) Board-certified endocrinologists who treat thyroid disorder must keep up-to-date on current thyroid disorder treatments. Such treatments should be incorporated into the already established continued medical education (CME) programs. Continuing education in this area should be maintained to keep certification in Endocrinology. It is inexcusable that endocrinologists are treating thyroid patients and not reading current practices in that discipline such as the use of natural thyroid, T3-only medication and T3/T4 combination therapies.Many patients are speaking out about the inadequacy of T4-only synthetic drugs. Patients on natural thyroid typically express the improvement in the quality of their life. Improvements are also reported by patients using T3/T4 treatments or T3-only, as opposed to synthetic T4-only. However, T4 synthetic drugs are usually the only prescriptions considered. The dosage on the prescription is based on TSH level. Patients report that the TSH level does not necessarily correlate with symptoms. Thus, a patient may have a target TSH level, but still be under-treated. New tests, such as Free T3, Reverse T3 and Free T4, tell a revealing story; however, endocrinologists generally are not utilizing these tests. Instead, they test for Total T4 and Total T3, but these do not quantify what hormones are free and useable within the body. Patients with thyroid dysfunction complain of difficulty with mood management and lethargy. To remedy this, endocrinologists recommend anti-depressants or refer us to psychiatrists. This is a travesty and an oversight. Research demonstrates an improvement of depression using T3 medication. However, thyroid patients find it challenging to find endocrinologists willing to prescribe Cytomel or natural thyroid, which contain T3. The failure of an endocrinologist to correctly attribute the psychological and systemic symptoms of a thyroid patient to thyroid dysfunction perpetuates the patient's illness. This usually leads to the prescription of a pharmaceutical that may alleviate the reported symptoms, but ignores the root cause; the mismanaged thyroid.Thyroid dysfunction and ineffective treatment of thyroid dysfunction is also correlated with high cholesterol levels. When a patient has high cholesterol, endocrinologists prescribe dangerous statins when T3 supplementation can lower our cholesterol more safely.Endocrinologists may be skilled in diabetes and innovative in this sub-specialty, but appear to be lacking the knowledge and expertise in thyroid diagnoses and management.  This is unacceptable. As a result, patients are forced to self-educate, self-treat or worse, receive inadequate treatment and suffer needlessly. Many patients feel failed by the medical community and are turning to online sources and sharing knowledge. One such online source is the method pioneered by Paul Robinson who has created and published a method of administering thyroid hormone, mainly T3, according to circadian rhythm or T3CM. Patients are finding relief with his T3CM method. Paul Robinson is not a doctor, rather, he is a patient who has suffered over twenty years from inadequate thyroid treatment.This petition is bringing the underground movement created by thyroid patients the mainstream attention that it deserves.

Justice pour la victime du viol et du meurtre de Kathua

Nous sommes désespérées par le retard injustifiable dans l’enquête de l’odieux viol et du meurtre d’une mineure de 8 ans, appartenant à la tribu des Bakerwals, dans le village de Rassana, Hiranagar, district de Kathua.

Nous sommes également inquiètes de la politisation excessive et la communautarisation d’un événement qui n’est rien d’autre qu’exploitation et brutalité sexuelles, et meurtre.

Nous sommes aussi préoccupées par la façon éhontée dont le discours ultra-nationaliste est utilisé pour contrer les campagnes réclamant justice pour la victime et ainsi protéger les coupables.

Son corps a été retrouvé dans la forêt de Rassana le 17 janvier, une semaine après sa disparition. Son corps portait des marques de torture et elle avait été violée avant d'être tuée. La victime âgée de 8 ans appartenait à une tribu nomade marginalisée et opprimée dont la vulnérabilité et la victimisation sont bien connues.

La succession des événements montre qu'il y a eu une tentative délibérée d'une section au sein du gouvernement pour contrecarrer le processus d'enquête dans l'affaire, dès la disparition de la petite fille. Des reportages ont souligné la réticence de la police à lancer un avis de recherche et à entamer une chasse à l'homme pour retrouver la fillette. Même après que son corps a été retrouvé, le processus d'enquête nécessaire, y compris la collecte de preuves et l'enregistrement des déclarations, n'a pas été fait de manière adéquate. Au lieu de cela, la famille de la victime et ceux qui militent pour lui rendre justice ont été constamment harcelés et intimidés.

L’enquête est passée des mains d'une première équipe spéciale d'investigation, incluant la police, à une deuxième, puis à la section criminelle, qui examine actuellement l'affaire. Un mineur et deux officiers de police ont été arrêtés comme principaux suspects, mais l’enquête ne progresse pas beaucoup. Alors que la section criminelle suit la procédure légale, la cadence est entravée par la montée du communautarisme et de la politisation. A ce stade, toute tentative de transférer l'affaire à un autre organisme entraverait davantage l’enquête et nous craignons que cela puisse être fait dans l’intention de protéger les coupables.

Nous pensons qu'il y a une tentative délibérée d’étouffer l'affaire en construisant un récit commun autour du crime odieux et de son investigation. De manière choquante, les différents intérêts personnels essayant de saboter l’enquête à travers la communautarisation du crime et sa politisation n'incluent pas seulement un groupe marginal d’extrême droite, mais aussi deux hauts ministres de l'alliance au pouvoir. Une telle situation a également encouragé d'autres groupes politiques à répliquer, non pas du point de vue de la victime, mais pour atteindre des objectifs politiques mesquins et pour alimenter le discours communautariste.

Nous appelons tous les groupes politiques à mettre fin à l'effroyable politisation et à la communautarisation du crime; ainsi que de mettre fin au harcèlement de la famille de la victime. En tant que femmes, nous sommes extrêmement choquées et consternées par la façon dont les situations d'oppression fondées sur le genre se voient appropriées par les mentalités patriarcales à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur du pouvoir pour détourner la justice et même voler les victimes de leur statut de victime.

Nous demandons également au gouvernement de veiller à ce que les enquêtes de la section criminelle fassent l’objet d’une procédure accélérée et soient suivies d'un procès, lui aussi accéléré, afin que justice soit rendue.

According to Bernard and Sallamondra Robinson, their 25-year-old daughter Shanquella Robinson left Charlotte on an excursion to Cabo, Mexico, on October 28 with a group of friends. Shanquella's mother stated that she spoke to her on a Friday night while she was eating dinner, and then on Saturday night, her 'friends' called to say that they were contacting a doctor because she wasn't feeling well. And although the doctor hadn't arrived yet when they called, they nevertheless reported that she had alcohol poisoning. However, her parents didn't believe that their daughter died from alcohol poisoning.

After they said it was alcohol poisoning, Shanquella'parents received the autopsy report, and it said that her neck had been fractured, that she had a back spasm and that there was a break. Her spinal cord was cracked. That raised the stakes significantly because it indicated that she had been attacked.

The U.S. Department of State released the following statement in response to the death: “We are aware of these reports. Protecting the welfare of U.S. citizens overseas is among our top priorities. Out of respect for the privacy of those involved, we have no further comment at this time.”

Furthermore, in order to shed light on the circumstances behind Shanquella Robinson's passing, the family contacted the Charlotte FBI field office. They are also considering hiring a private investigator.Lastly, Shanquella Robinson's body returned to Charlotte on Thursday, and the funeral service will be next Saturday.

Please sign and share this petition to help bring justice for Shanquella Robinson.

There is a video of Shanquella's 'friend' attacking her right before her death. Therefore, her death needs to be investigated. Here is the video of what happened

Jesy bravely spoke about how this affected her and led her to attempt suicide in a desperate attempt to end the pain she was feeling.

But it’s not just celebrities who receive online abuse – everyone with an online presence is susceptible. The most harrowing scenes in the film are of Jesy meeting Ann and Paul, the parents of Sian Waterhouse, a 16-year-old girl who died by suicide as a result of online trolling. She later meets a group of teenagers who have also been abused online, each of them thankful for each other and their willingness to share their stories.

The reality is that online abuse can affect anyone and we need to encourage young people to talk about this and understand the impact of their actions.

This petition is for the government to ensure that this BBC documentary is shared in every secondary school across Britain to educate kids and open up the discussion so that young people feel ok to speak up if they’re experiencing bullying.

780 young people under the age of 25 took their own life in 2018. Bullying was a contributory factor in many of those cases and we need to fight and do all we can to prevent anyone from feeling that way!

Querido Leo,

Nos referimos a você assim com tanta intimidade porque há tempos acompanhamos as suas muitas vidas nas telas. Nos debulhamos em lágrimas quando Romeu pensou que Julieta estava morta, pelo menos uma vez abrimos nossos braços e gritamos ao vento “I'm the king of the world!” e torcemos para que Frank Abagnale Jr. sempre escapasse.

Também por isso sentimos que podemos clamar por sua ajuda como quem pede auxílio a um super-herói.

Recentemente, o presidente brasileiro lançou denúncias falsas contra você, acusando-o de colocar fogo na Amazônia. Essa afirmação, que à primeira vista pode parecer apenas patética, é, no fundo, trágica e grave.

Desde a campanha eleitoral, ele vem dando declarações enganosas, preconceituosas e violentas sobre negros, indígenas, comunidade LGBTQI+, mulheres e outros grupos socialmente vulneráveis. É notório que a violência e o ódio a esses grupos vêm crescendo no Brasil, autorizados por tais declarações.

Na mesma ocasião em que você foi acusado de incendiar a Amazônia, a sede da Saúde e Alegria – uma das ONGs atuantes na Amazônia mais reconhecidas do mundo – foi invadida pela polícia. Quatro ativistas voluntários da Brigada de Incêndio de Alter do Chão foram presos, acusados de colocar fogo na Amazônia – assim como você.

No mesmo dia, um exército de criadores de fake news começou a fazer circular falsas gravações e conversas de WhatsApp que ""provavam"" a participação desses jovens idealistas na produção de incêndios.

Veja que aqui a ficção anda a serviço da manipulação da realidade e tem gerado injustiça e violência.

Nós aqui, crendo no alcance benéfico da ficção, imaginamos que um processo judicial de um astro de Hollywood contra a mentira deslavada e irresponsável de um presidente poderia ajudar a trazer justiça àqueles que como você foram acusados, mas que seguem sendo encarcerados, ameaçados de morte e sofrendo perseguição judicial.

Por isso iniciamos aqui uma campanha: Leonardo DiCaprio, por favor, processe o nosso presidente.

Cordialmente,

Dear Leo,

We refer to you like that so intimately because we have long been following your many lives on screen. We burst into tears when Romeo thought Juliet was dead, at least once we spread our arms and shouted to the wind ""I'm the king of the world!"" and we sincerely hoped Frank Abagnale Jr. would escape.

This is also why we feel we can appeal to you as someone who asks help from a superhero.

Recently, the Brazilian president threw false allegations against you, accusing you of setting fire to the Amazon rainforest. This statement, which at first glance may seem only pathetic, is indeed tragic and serious. Since the election campaign, he has been giving misleading, prejudiced and violent statements about black and indigenous people, LGBTQI+ community, women and other socially vulnerable groups. It is well known that violence and hatred towards these groups has been growing, authorized by these statements.

At the same time that you were accused of burning down the forest, the headquarters of Saúde e Alegria – one of the most recognized Amazonian NGOs in the world – was overrun by police. Four volunteer activists from the Alter do Chão Fire Brigade were arrested by police on charges of setting fire to the Amazon – just like you.

On the same day, an army of fake news creators began circulating fake WhatsApp recordings and conversations that ""proved"" the participation of these young idealists in the production of fires.

Note that here fiction is at the service of manipulation of reality and has generated injustice and violence.

We, believing in the beneficial range of fiction, imagine that a Hollywood star's lawsuit against a president's blatant and irresponsible lie could help bring justice to those who like you have been accused, but continue to be incarcerated, threatened with death and suffering judicial persecution.

Therefore we started now a campaign:

Leonardo DiCaprio, please sue our president!

Parents are kept awake at night worrying about the long-term future of their children with disabilities, and they struggle every day to get proper supports for them.  Meanwhile, their concerns are often shrugged off when their children are placed inappropriately -- in segregated classes or schools, in workshops paying pennies a day, and even in seniors' homes.  For example, lively 49-year-old Teresa Pocock (pictured above) was rescued from a long-term care facility that specialized in dementia and palliative care patients.  Teresa is just one of thousands, and most don't get out! (See her petition: www.change.org/teresapocock, which was recently closed when she received a personal letter of apology from Dr. Eric Hoskins, Ontario's Minister of Health.)

In her June 22 announcement on consultation for new disability legislation, the Minister of Sport and Disabilities, Carla Qualtrough, acknowledged just how defenceless people with disabilities are:  “Right now, within our current legal framework, the rights of those of us with disabilities don’t kick in ... until our rights have been violated. The current system unfairly burdens Canadians to ever defend our rights.”

Obviously, persons with disabilities should not have to defend their rights in court, yet at present violations under the CRPD cannot even be reported to the UN because Canada has not signed the Protocol.  If it truly wants to protect disability rights, therefore, our current government will need to attend to this unfinished business of the previous government.

In signing the CRPD, the Canadian government promised to uphold the rights of persons with disabilities.  If it enforces its own disability laws the Protocol will not be necessary -- otherwise Canadians will need it as a final resort.

Over 26,000 Canadians are looking forward to having Prime Minister Trudeau safeguard disability rights by signing and ratifying the Protocol by the end of 2017.



Please sign this petition and urge Prime Minister Trudeau to add this task to his priority list.

Chaque année, Le Monde et France Culture décernent un prix de l'essai. Cette année, ils l'ont décerné à Nathalie Heinich, l'une des idéologues les plus engagés dans la légitimation des idéologies homophobes et des schémas de la manif pour tous.

Il y a quelques années, ses inacceptables et choquantes prises de position (notamment dans la revue le Débat) contre le mariage gay (décrit comme une ""perversion"") avaient été résumées ainsi sur un blog de Yagg :

""Nathalie Heinich affirme à l’envie que le mariage pour tous est « une perversion de l’idéal républicain », « très exactement, un dispositif pervers », « une multiple perversion ». Et, comme si ce n’était pas suffisant, elle ajoute, pour fustiger à nouveau « de tels dispositifs pervers » : « La perversité va souvent de pair avec le déni ». Etonnante, cette propension à parler de « perversion » en martelant le mot, dans un article sur les LGBT.

La sociologue prétend également que les militants des droits LGBT ont « invoqué, comme cela a été fait », un « droit à l’enfant »… alors que cette expression, en réalité, provient justement des opposants aux droits civils pour les LGBT ! Mais le morceau de bravoure de Nathalie Heinich est sans doute celui-ci, qu’il faut lire in extenso pour l’apprécier :

« Dans le cas [des homosexuels], l’incapacité [à procréer] ne relève pas d’une donnée physiologique mais d’un choix de vie, en l’occurrence le choix de refuser le commerce sexuel avec l’autre sexe, même dans un but purement procréatif. »

Eh oui : pour Nathalie Heinich, l’homosexualité est un choix. Elle admet pourtant trois pages plus loin que « désirs ou pulsions ne relèvent pas d’un choix », mais, comme elle n’est pas à une contradiction près, elle fustige tout aussitôt « le déni des conséquences du choix d’identité sexuelle sur l’accès à la procréation ». Aux LGBT qui ne cachent pas leur homosexualité, elle préfère en outre « les nombreux homosexuels qui choisissent de ne pas s’afficher comme tels dans toutes les dimensions de leur existence ».

Faut-il en rajouter ? En tout cas, Nathalie Heinich, elle, en rajoute. Selon elle, les LGBT qui souhaitent avoir des droits équivalents à ceux des hétérosexuels ont :

« Un mode de fonctionnement psychique qui ne connaît d’autre modalité de transaction avec le réel que le fantasme infantile de toute-puissance opposé à une autorité forcément maléfique, et forcément coupable ».

« Perversion », « fantasme infantile », « fonctionnement psychique » perturbé, « choix de vie », rejet d’un « droit à l’enfant » prétendument « invoqué »… : Nathalie Heinich remplit allègrement une ligne complète sur le bingo des arguments stupides contre les droits LGBT.""

Les prises de position réactionnaires ne se limitent pas à ces questions, mais couvrent pratiquement tout le spectre des sujets (politiques, avec évidemment ces positions sur le féminisme, ou encore esthétiques, cf. ses écrit sur l'art contemporain ..) . Et ce point de vue informe la moindre ligne de ses écrits, qui ne constituent que l'expression de tous les réflexes mentaux des idéologues conservateurs face aux conquêtes de la pensée de Bourdieu et de la sociologie critique et déterministe.

On se demande comment un jury peut avoir eu une idée aussi choquante. Ce sont les mêmes qui vont protester contre telle émission de télévision vulgaire, contre telle pratique d'oppression des LGBT dans tel pays, mais qui participent activement à une opération qui vise à rendre fréquentable une activiste anti-gay...

L'année dernière, le jury était composé pour France Culture de : Caroline Broué, Brice Couturier, Hervé Gardette, et Sandrine Treiner et pour Le Monde de : Anne Chemin, Julie Clarini, Nicolas Weill et Jean Birnbaum.

Le prix lui sera remis le 13 juillet à l'occasion des Rencontres de Pétrarque à Montpellier.

Nous exprimons ici le choc et la violence que représente l'attribution d'un tel prix à N. Heinich. Nous condamnons ce choix inacceptable et incompatible avec les valeurs démocratiques qui devraient animer une radio de service public et un grand quotidien. Nous demandons aux membres du jury de revenir sur leur choix.

Today we address you as Cypriot people from different backgrounds and nationalities, but with our shared love for Cyprus - and hate for violence.

As you know today in Europe there is a war. Innocent people, children are killed and tortured. The ancient Greek Ukrainian city of Mariiupol has been under siege for over a month and over 150,000 people are trapped there without food or water or other necessities for life. They are starving to death because the Russian Army will not allow humanitarian aid to enter and help. Every day the world is shocked even more by the new war crimes that are happening on the daily basis. Today it is Bucha, tomorrow it may be any other city or village that stands in the way of Putin's war machine. The world has not seen these types of war crimes since WW2 and Hitler.

On the 9th of April here in Limassol, there is a planned Pro Putin and Pro Russian march and meeting. They will be marching with Russian flags, Putin portraits, and symbol Z. In many European countries this symbol is now forbidden or is being considered forbidden. It represents violence. The demonstrators will be yelling out 'Let's go Russia', 'Putin is the Best leader' 'Death to America.' All this already happened in Paphos and Larnaca in the last few weeks. But this was all before the world knew about the war crimes in Bucha and possible genocide in Ukraine. We have received many calls from our friends from all over the world in disbelief that these marches and demonstrations are really happening in Cyprus. Russian Media uses these as propaganda to show the Russian people that what they are doing in Ukraine is OK and the world is supporting them even in Cyprus.

On April 9 Putin supporters will walk and drive through the heart of Limassol honking and yelling in support of war and violence. Cyprus is a democratic country, and we are proud of it. We are proud of our freedom of speech, but this march is crossing all borders. Putin supporters are calling for violence and hate and this should not happen here, not anywhere!!

Mr. President, only you can stop this madness. Limassol is your hometown please do all you can to stop this march of hate and violence. Today it is so important to people who value freedom, peace, and democracy.

Glory to Cyprus!

Glory to Ukraine!

Glory to Freedom!

Сегодня в Европе идет война, гибнут мирные люди, дети. Древний греко-украинский Мариуполь уже месяц в осаде, там осталось 150000 мирных людей, им нечего есть и пить. Они умирают, но к ним не пускают гуманитарный груз, не пускают хлеб и воду.  Путинская армия не пускает..

Сегодня Международный Уголовный Суд работает под Киевом изучая все зверства и бандитизм Путинской российской армии над мирными людьми.

Убитые и изнасилованные дети, останки голых женщин брошенных прямо на дороге, матери, сошедшие с ума, сидят над трупами своих детей…

Такого чудовища Европа не видела с времен Гитлера.

У нас в Лимассоле 9 апреля запланрован про-путинский и про-российский марш.  С флагами России, портретами Путина и символикой Z , уже запрещенной в Германии и других странах Европы.  Будут лозунги : “ Вперед Россия”, “ Путин лучший лидер в мире” , “Смерть Америке”.  Это все уже было,

было в Ларнаке и Пафосе.  Но тогда мир еще не знал о преступлениях в Буче, о возможном признании геноцида в Украине.

Этих  шествий почти нет нигде в Европе и мире, мы получаем сотни звонков со всех уголков мира, спрашивающих как такое может быть на Кипре.

9 апреля путинские агитаторы проедут на наших улицах, пройдут под нашими окнами с выкриками одобряющими войну и насилие.

Кипр демократическая страна и мы гордимся этим, мы гордимся что плюрализм реален у нас на деле, но марш пропутинских активистов это нечто иное.  Это поддержка войны и бесчинства, это агитация ненависти и насилия.

Господин Президент, только Вы можете остановить это безумие.

Лимассол Ваш родной город, сделайте так чтобы его улицы не замарали себя

грязными акциями и пропагандой войны и диктаторства. Сегодня это очень важно для всех кто ценит свободу, мир и демократию.

Никакая гуманитарная поддержка не сможет сравниться с тем, что Вы можете сделать для страдающего и стонущего в войне народа.

Слава Кипру !

Слава Украине !

Слава Свободе!

Στις 9 Απριλιου ειναι προγραματισμενη μια πορεια και συναντηση υπερ του Πουτιν και Ρωσσιας στη Λεμεσο. Θα πορευονται με Ρωσσικες σημαιες, φωτογραφιες του Πουτιν και το συμβολο ‘Ζ’.  Σε πολλες χωρες της Ευρωπης αυτο το συμβολο ειναι τωρα απαγορευμενο η θεωρειται απαγορευμενο.  Συμβολιζει βια. Οι διαδηλωτες θα φωναζουν ‘Παμε Ρωσσια’ ‘ο Πουτιν ειναι ο καλυτερος ηγετης’ ‘θανατος στην Αμερικη’.  Ολα αυτα εχουν ηδη γινει στην Παφο και Λαρνακα τις τελευταιες βδομαδες.  Αλλα ολα αυτα πριν να γνωριζει ο κοσμος για τα εγκληματα πολεμου στη Bucha και πιθανη γενοκτονια στην Ουκρανια. Εχουμε λαβει πολλα τηλεφωνηματα απο φιλους απο ολο τον κοσμο που θεωρουν απιστευτο οτι αυτες οι πορειες και δαμαρτυριες συμβαινουν προγματικα στην Κυπρο.  Τα Ρωσσικα μεσα επικοινωνιας τα χρησιμοποιουν ως προπαγανδα για να δειχνουν στον Ρωσσικο λαο οτι αυτα που συμβαινουν στην Ουκρανια ειναι καλα και οτι ο κοσμος εινα υπερ τους ακομα και η Κυπρος.

Στις 9 Απριλιου οι υποστιρικτες του Πουτιν θα πορευτουν και θα κινηθουν με αυτοκινητα στο κεντρο της Λεμεσου κορναροντας και κραυγαζοντας υπερ του πολεμου και της βιας.  Η Κυπρος εινα μια δημοκρατικη χωρα και ειμαστε υπερηφανοι γι’αυτο.  Ειμαστε υπερηφανοι για την ελευθερια λογου αλλα αυτη η πορεια ξεπερναει καθε οριο. Οι υποστηρικτες του Πουτιν φωναζουν υπερ της βιας και του μισους και αυτο δεν θα επρεπε να συμβαινει εδω η οπουδηποτε!!

Κυριε Προεδρε, μονο εσεις μπορειτε να σταματησετε αυτη την παραφροσυνη.  Η Λεμεσος ειναι η γενετειρα σας, κανετε οτι μπορειτε να σταματησετε αυτην την πορεια μισους και βιας.  Σημερα εινα τοσο σημαντικο στους ανθρωπους που εκτιμουν την ελευθερια, την ειρηνη και την δημοκρατια.

Δοξα στην Κυπρο!

Δοξα στην Ουκρανια!

Δοξα στην Ελευθερια!

Kyra can not communicate verbally, use her left hand, or walk so she requires full time disability support workers for all of her personal care and to access her life.

The average household in Victoria is 2.6 people. Due to Kyra’s disability her household consists of 22 people. Kyra has nearly ten times more people in her household than the average Victorian. The current Covid-19 rule of 7 days isolation if you are a close household contact to a positive case of Covid-19 means that Kyra could potentially spend her life in a repetitive cycle of isolation.

Kyra is currently isolating for 7 days because one of her disability support workers, hence household contact, supported Kyra while infected with Covid-19. Covid-19 is now very prevalent in our community and the chances of disability support workers continuing to enter Kyra’s home and support her while infected with Covid-19 is high.

Kyra has an active, stimulating life outside of her house. She volunteers, participates and contributes to our community. Kyra does not deserve to spend her days in isolation, unable to make any real plans because she is forced into home isolation due to the high probability of being a household contact to Covid-19.

Every disability support worker needs to have a Rapid Antigen Test administered and to produce a negative result before entering disability supported accommodation. Without this basic necessity Kyra and the other people residing in disability support accommodation are not able to have equal access to their lives and the federally legislated Disability Discrimination Act 1992 is being breached.

On behalf of my daughter and every person residing in disability supported accommodation I urge the government to respond with an action plan that will see disability support workers having a funded Rapid Antigen Test before each shift. Urgent and active response is required."

So let the people police the police. We have a say in who our local treasurer will be, but not the people that carry guns around to ""protect"" us.

I propose a new law, carried out by the state, that makes all complaints and investigations regarding police officers and their history of violence and excessive force public record. With this information we, the people, should have the ability to immediately call for the firing or resignation of those officers, as a community. This can be via public forum or local election, with the officer remaining on unpaid leave until resolution.

We do not trust the justice system to resolve these issues of systemic racism in a timely manner and people will continue to die in the meantime.

Allow the people of the United States to make local decisions regarding WHO they want to allow to protect and serve THEM. Anything less than that is oppression."

The argument he is making is that the threat to society is law abiding citizens that have firearms are a danger to society. He never mentioned that criminals with Firearms are the actual threat and that he has no plans to disarm them whatsoever.



In fact, he wants those South Africans who cannot rely on any other means other than their firearms to protect them against the violent crime wave in this country, to willingly hand over their last line of defence to an institution that has been proved to sell the very firearms you hand over to the very criminals you need protection from.



The consequence if he is allowed to continue upon this path of insanity will result  in either your ability to defend yourself and your family against terrorism being removed and/or you being viewed as a criminal by government.



Sign this petition because we as South Africans demand a commissioner who understands the actual problem and takes reasonable and rational action to solve the problem and not persecute the victims of the South African crime wave.

Shocking video footage shared on social media shows French international and West Ham footballer Kurt Zouma drop kicking and slapping his pet Bengal cat in the presence of both his brother and a young child (the example set?) . Both Zouma and his brother can be heard laughing throughout the footage.

The mere fact that Zouma considers this funny and worthy of sharing on the Snapchat platform shows his disdain for animals and leads us to wonder what happens to animals in Zouma’s ‘care’ privately?

In the UK we have laws against the abuse of animals, laws which should be applicable to everyone rich or poor, famous or not!

We ask that the Metropolitan Police and RSPCA carry out an urgent investigation and prosecute the perpetrators of this heinous act.

Further we ask that the RSPCA remove all animals from Zouma’s ‘care’ immediately!

Failure to take action in this case will send the message that animal abuse for entertainment is justified, that for the rich and famous breaking the law is no problem! Neither are acceptable!

Le simple fait que Zouma considère cela comme drôle et digne d'être partagé sur la plateforme Snapchat montre son mépris pour les animaux et nous amène à nous demander ce qu'il advient des animaux dont Zouma est ""soigné"" en privé ?

De plus, nous demandons à la RSPCA de retirer immédiatement tous les animaux des « soins » de Zouma !

Most of my friends who contracted HIV (10 to 15 years before me) are dead now. But BECAUSE of them, by 1996, I was on HAART (the cocktail of drugs) that has kept me alive & healthy.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force announced that PrEP (aka: Truvada, one of the drugs I take) should be offered by doctors as a major form of HIV prevention. But there’s a huge hurdle to getting on PrEP - the cost. Without insurance, a 30-day supply of PrEP can cost roughly $1,700. Even with insurance, the costs can be prohibitive. But the House Subcommittee on Health can do something about it, they can make PrEP a part of preventative care. This would mean patients could get PrEP for free, no matter the cost.

In the U.S., HIV rates are actually increasing among Latino and African American men. Southern states had half of all new HIV cases in 2016.

418,Heart Foundation: Stop giving advice and promoting food that causes heart disease!,"REAL, whole food. Actual food that contains vitamins, minerals and all that the body requires to",['CEO'],Jessie Reimers,"Gold Coast, Australia",56818,4 Mar 2013,https:https://static.change.org/images/default-petition-darker.gif,"We are asking that the Heart Foundation update their nutrition advice based on the current science and research and scrap the Tick of Approval program as it is giving consumers a false sense of security and is placed on products that contribute to inflammation, heart disease and other illness.

I have explained in detail my reasons for starting this video in this youtube clip. You can also watch the segment on Sunrise where we explain the petition and this segment on Studio 10.

The Heart Foundation currently advises that we steer clear of ‘dangerous’ saturated fats, consume margarine, vegetable and seed oils, keep our cholesterol low, low, low, consume a diet made up of mostly REFINED, highly processed carbohydrates and choose foods with the tick of approval, the very large majority of which are highly processed, devoid of essential nutrients and many of which contain huge amounts of sugar (for example Milo Cereal which is 27% refined sugar). Here is a study linking added sugar with heart disease.

They claim that this advice is based on solid scientific evidence- however the evidence they continue to produce is very outdated and has been debunked by major studies many, many times since. All I am finding is more and more evidence to suggest that saturated fat and cholesterol are NOT associated with cardiovascular disease and that this idea was based initially on an extremely faulty study by Ancel Keys, who cherry picked data in an attempt to prove what he wanted to prove. If all of the data had been used they would have found absolutely NO correlation between saturated fat and heart disease- yet somehow this out-dated and even dangerous hypothesis is clung to so that margarine, cholesterol lowering medications and all manner of unnecessary and most certainly very unhealthy and damaging products can be sold.

Vegetable/seed oils and margarine are of particular concern. More information about this here.

Here is an example of evidence to suggest that saturated fat is not linked with heart disease. This is a MASSIVE meta-analysis involving over 340,000 subjects. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/91/3/535

You will find many more studies here.

In fact saturated fat and dietary cholesterol from natural, healthy sources such as butter from grass fed cows, animal fats from naturally raised animals, eggs (including the cholesterol filled yolk), unrefined coconut oil etc have been found to be extremely beneficial to health and actually assist in protecting, NOT causing cardiovascular disease. There has been a great deal of research and science to show this which has been largely ignored by the medical and scientific communities and by Heart Foundations and nutritional authorities around the world.  Some of these researchers, scientists, Drs, cardiovascular surgeons, obesity experts, authors, nutritionists etc include  Dr Eric Westman, USA; Dr Andreas Eenfeldt, Sweden; Dr Malcolm Kendrick, UK; late Dr Barry Groves, UK; Dr William Davis, US; Dr Gary Fettke, Australia and Dr Perlmetter, USA, Zoe Harcombe, Dr John Briffa, Dr Chris Kresser, Cyndi O’Meara, Dr Sandra Cabot, Sally Fallon, Christine Cronau, David Gillespie, Uffe Ranskov, Anthony Colpo and there are many others, all of whom rely on evidence based research and a great deal of well respected scientific studies, not on merely 'opinion' or 'quackery'. It is time people learned the truth. The current advice CONTRIBUTES to inflammation, heart disease and a whole host of unpleasant and unnecessary medical complications.

Honestly it just seems absolutely ridiculous that a health authority like the Heart Foundation whom many of the public trust and listen to, advise to eat a diet made up of mostly processed carbohydrates in the form of cereal, bread and pasta, consume margarine and vegetable/seed oils- which are unnatural and contribue to inflammation, processed sugar filled foods filled with additives, preservatives, colours and flavours and which are devoid of essential nutrients and even products that contain aspartame. How can they honestly say that this will protect people against cardiovascular disease? Whilst telling people to avoid fat and cholesterol which is absolutely essential to the correct functioning of the body on so many levels.

We need to be educating people to eat REAL, whole food. Actual food that contains vitamins, minerals and all that the body requires to operate and protect itself effectively. This isn't rocket science, it is simply what humans have always done. These new ideas to consume man made fats, margarine and processed foods are very much part of the health disaster.

These rollbacks to the monument will only further endanger this special place.We must preserve this treasure to ensure a healthy ocean for generations to come.The Biden Administration should act immediately to restore the protections to the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument."

Together, we codified civil rights for 25 million rape survivors in America. Now I’m asking you to take this movement global.

Sexual violence is a universal issue that demands international recognition. In fact, 1.3 billion people are sexual assault survivors. The United Nations (UN) was founded to protect the equality of all people, regardless of who they are or where they live. Yet, the UN General Assembly has never passed a resolution focused solely on sexual violence.

At Rise, we believe justice should not depend on geography. Basic protections against sexual violence and access to justice should be available to everyone, no matter their gender, age, nationality or citizenship. Around the world, protesters are marching to demand recognition and justice for survivors who are denied basic rights and access to justice. Countries are actively reforming sexual violence legislation to improve survivors’ access to justice. This represents a growing global consensus that survivors of sexual violence deserve certain basic rights. For the first time in history, an UNGA Sexual Violence Survivors’ Rights Resolution would enshrine that survivors’ rights are fundamental human rights:

With the passage of this United Nations resolution, we will bear witness to all survivors in their pursuit of justice, guaranteeing basic civil rights protections and absolving them of any custom, tradition or religious consideration that may delay or diminish this pursuit.

But we need your help. Many of these member states have constitutional petition laws in place requiring their governments to review all petitions. With your signatures and support, we can bring our Survivors’ Bill of Rights into the conversation and begin the work to ensure justice does not depend on geography.

Please sign this petition and demand the leader of your member nation take appropriate steps to review the plight of sexual violence and the injustice survivors face.

Thank You.

423,"End ""catch up"" and let's ""build up"". Extend principles of quality early education to 7.","The world has changed forever. It is long past time that our education system changed too even though the EYFS does.  Ask anyone who is trained in early education- this crucial phase spans, engage and work with us to give every child the education they need.","['Nadhim Zahawi MP', 'Will Quince MP', 'Robin Walker MP']",Elaine Bennett,"Southend-on-sea, United Kingdom",51937,14 Feb 2016,https://assets.change.org/photos/0/yb/nn/sAYbNnyDkwauOkE-800x450-noPad.jpg?1650221653,"The world has changed forever. It is long past time that our education system changed too.

Everyday there are stories being printed about the impact of the Covid pandemic on our youngest children. ""Children are XX months behind"", ""Children are not ready for school"", ""Children can't do this, that or the other"", or the idea that families didn't do enough to support their children over lockdown. The deficit model is alive and well. Disrespectful and disingenuous to children, their families and their educators.

Educators are reporting the challenges (often in relation to communication, social and emotional learning) that they face in the classroom and the frustration at not being able to go back to the basics as they face a relentless ""catch up"" barrage and a pressure to formalise learning for children who are simply not ready, in a bid to ""close the gap"" (who defines the gap) and ""catch them up (to who- pre pandemic cohorts?) The Governments response has been to offer intervention programmes to schools. However there are issue's with these catch up programmes: they require staff (who schools simply do not have) to run them (and complete the increased workload), they remove already stretched staff from the place they need to be, where they have the most impact- with children in the classroom. These programmes also remove children (quite often the youngest) from the very place they need to be- in their classroom/setting with their peers engaging in purposeful play.

We need to stop. Take a breath and consider the following: Is the truth of the matter that children are not coping in our schools? Or is in fact the school system that is not coping with the children who are within it?  Is it time for change?

This petition is now 6 years old, with 50,000 supporters. The need for change is nothing new- but in 2022 it is no longer just a vision, an ideal, a dream- it is a necessity.

Our children are not lacking. However the system they find themselves thrust into at the age of 4 is.

It is time to what must be done, what has been lacking from policy for far too long. The child. Their voice. Their development. We need to begin with the child. Where they are and build from there- together- schools, parents/carers, outside agencies. What matters in the EYFS (0-5) STILL matters when children are in Year one and two- perhaps now more than ever before:

*Child development

*High quality teaching (interactions and relationships)

*A rich enabling environment which promotes holistic learning

*Play, enquiry and investigation as a powerful and creative vehicle for learning



Of course maths and literacy matter- no one who educates and cares for children would disagree- but these areas of learning require strong foundations, a bedrock to build upon- and right now the system is  simply not laying these foundations- there is no time for what really matters. Instead in a ""do it sooner, do it quicker"" system the essential foundations are completely ignored.

Language, communication, physical development, personal, social and emotional development (the prime areas of the EYFS) as well as ""how of learning"" (Characteristics of Effective Learning) are the basis for everything and must be woven through ever drop of learning our children encounter- including reading, writing and maths.

The good news is that we CAN have a 0-7 curriculum with relationships, environments, play, learning and child development at its core. The early years of life do not end at age 4 or 5 even though the EYFS does.  Ask anyone who is trained in early education- this crucial phase spans birth to  7.  This when the developmental shift occurs and children are ready for learning to become more formal and abstract.  This is why most of the worlds children starting formal schooling at 6 or 7 years old. Not before.



So... NOW is the time that we MUST

*Recognise that  children are not behind and do not need catching up, we cannot speed up their development with scripts, schemes and flashcards.  They have lived through the biggest crisis in our living memory and need an educational experience that reflects and respects this.

*End the Baseline, phonics screening and SATs permanently. *

*Build a curriculum based on child development, international evidence, work of EYs pioneers and their contemporaries from birth to 7.

*Put mental health, play, child development, wellbeing and relationships at the heart of the curriculum.

*Work transparently across political parties, across nations and across the sector with practitioners, academics, organisations and communities to build a transformational curriculum for all children 0-7

Let's stand together to make a change for the future. In the past it may have been a dream. Now it’s a necessity.

We the sector ask that you listen, engage and work with us to give every child the education they need."

In response to the countless tragic events that have occurred, and are occurring, globally and nationally, regarding racism it is clearer than ever that education on white privilege and systemic racism in our schools across the UK is essential and must be implemented as a mandatory part of our school curriculum. It is vital that we educate adolescents on the history of racism as well as the white privilege in order to lift the curtain on ‘white blindness’.  In order to achieve this, it is necessary to make it a mandatory part of the KS3 National Curriculum.

DOMESTIC & INTERNATIONAL CRISIS - NEED HELP

Christians in India are facing a Global crisis when it comes to persecution. Christian pastors and social workers have been tortured, killed and their properties have been burnt or destroyed. India is a Democratic secular nation and now this very freedom has been threatened by the miscreants.

Freedom of Religion in India is a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 25-28 of the Constitution of India to every citizen of India and also India is one of the most diverse nations in terms of religion since it is a democratic and secular country.

Now this very basic Human Right freedom has been threatened by Hindu extremists and fanatics who function like terrorists..similar to the ones who kill innocent people in the Middle east (under the umbrella of current Political party at power in India), questioning the very basic Human Rights Religious freedom in India during last 3 years from Dec 2014. This basic freedom guaranteed by the Constitution of India is now in jeopardy.

Now we seriously need your help to alert and inform those who are in Power & Authority in India to take immediate necessary steps to curtail this serious problem and protect Christian minorities especially Pastors and social/charity workers guaranteed by Article 25-28 of the Constitution of India. We also request you to inform Indian Government (current Political party at power, the Law makers and Law enforcement) to give full protection to Christian Minorities and take action against those who are involved in committing this heinous crimes.

One more important point to be noted, most of all Christian countries openly invite Indians (so called NRI's) and give them jobs thinking they are harmless people to work with. But the sad part is many NRIs of Hindu extremists groups who exists here in Christian Nations, migrate here for jobs & live here, are part of these groups who work like terrorists back in India. These Hindu extremist NRIs send money & funding back to these parties back in India, which is indirectly used to hurt Christian minorities who are not hurting anyone. Please check few articles which came in nationwide newspaper ""The Indian Express"" on 26th Feb 2014,

""NRI Indians are BJP’s biggest donor (Article from 26th Feb 2014)""http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/nri-indians-are-bjps-biggest-donor/

In addition these Hindu extremists groups In India also forget.. what if all Democratic Christian countries also react the same way back to them from every country.. like..- All Govt support & Funds sent from these Christian countries to India were stopped?- Close & destroy all Hindu temples in these Christian countries just like how they do to Christian minorities in India?- All Christian countries send kids or parents or Grandparents of Hindu faith even up to 3 generations back to their home country India by cancelling their visas, cancelling their permanent resident status & also revoking their Citizenship's in these Christian countries? So they can leave these Christian countries even if they are married to local citizen. Anything can happen and can be done by these Christian Nations- Stop all funds coming from Hindu temples in these Christian countries to these Hindu extremists groups in India?

Beware of these Hindu extremists kids and or their relatives who live in these Christian Democratic countries either studying or working can be of huge threat to these western Nations too. Their terrorist thoughts and killing Minorities (like how they do in India) can be of huge threat to these western Nations. So it is advisable to take necessary actions against Hindu extremists who live in these Christian Nations to send them back to India for the safety of your own Nation

We request also all Christian countries not to entertain these Hindu extremists politicians to visit their own country and waste their time, funds & efforts on Indian politicians. Everyone has their own agenda and indirectly affecting / hurting the faith of people (Christians from these Christian Nations) who help or fund them back in India. This was not brought to light by any media in India

Pastor Gideon Periyaswamy, aged 43 residing at: Adayachery, Near Koovathur (2km distance), Kalpakkam Tamilnadu India was brutally murdered and his body was hanged from ceiling to make it look like a suicide on 20th Jan 2018 (Saturday morning). His personal belonging was also stolen like Gold ring from his finger. No action has been taken by Police or local Authorities so far in taking efforts to nab the criminals.

We need justice and protection for all Christian Minorities in India. Now days like in March 2018 specially in South India like TN, the Hindu extremists persecute Christian Minorities in India like killing Pastors, Christian Minorities, Burning Churches & Bibles etc.

Your earliest help and action in this regard is highly appreciated. We sincerely solicit your intervention and necessary action at the earliest.

Не будьте равнодушны, на кону жизни 5 тысяч животных. У нас всего месяц времени...

Описание ситуацииВ СМИ говорится о том, что в Саратовской области зимой убьют пять тысяч лисиц. Этот отстрел, якобы, будет производиться для снижения их популяции. Численность этих животных сейчас составляет около 12,5 тыс. В 2019 году их было на две тыс. больше. Власти говорят, что снижение популяции нужно для того, чтобы контролировать уровень заболевания бешенством. Этот отстрел должен пройти с 1 по 31 декабря 2020 года.

Как проходит и что из себя представляет отстрелВо время отстрела на лис ставят капканы, засыпывают им норы, размещают ловушки в тех местах, где эти животные ищут пищу. Очень часто лис убивают в норах вместе с детёнышами. Иногда, обычно зимой, отстрел производится из снегоходов.Возможно лис убивают ради того, чтобы получить их мех, а потом продать его. Мы не знаем. Такие отстрелы в Саратовской области не редкость, они проводятся не только один раз в год, бывает и несколько раз. Из-за этого возникает вопрос: а для чего?

Почему отстрел нужно отменить и запретитьОтстрел - это жестокое и ничем не аргументированное убийство, в котором нет необходимости.Из-за отстрелов сородичей, лисы чувствуют себя в опасности, покидая свои естественные места обитания, они подходят ближе к людям и населённым пунктам.Чтобы предотвратить распространение бешенства, нужно подкидывать в места обитания лис корм с вакциной, как в других цивилизованных странах, а не убивать их.Если властям так важно снижение количества этих животных в Саратовской области, они могут их отловить и транспортировать в те регионы России, где популяция этого вида очень низкая. Это проще, чем убивать их. Тем более, что убить всех не смогут, и непонятно, каких именно они будут убивать - больных или здоровых. А вакцинировать можно всех.

Чем опасен отстрел лисОтстрел лис нарушит экосистему в регионе. Если количество этих животных снизится, начнёт увеличиваться популяция грызунов, которые являются опасными переносчиками, что нанесет сокрушительный удар не только по экологии, но и по экономике и здравоохранению.

Возможные последствия:1. Увеличится заболеваемость геморрагической лихорадкой с почечным синдромом (ГЛПС) и другими природно-очаговыми инфекционными заболеваниями.2. Увеличение популяции грызунов повлечет за собой увеличение численности иксодовых клещей3. Увеличится заболеваемость клещевым боррелиозом и вирусным энцефалитом.4. Увеличение численности грызунов повлечет за собой ухудшение санитарного состояния лесов и лесозащитных полос, полей.5. Увеличится число случаев заболевания бешенством среди диких животных и возникновения случаев среди домашних животных, также увеличится риск заражения бешенством людей.6. Из-за большого количества грызунов участится их миграция в населенные пункты, которые расположены вблизи лесов, что повлечет за собой напряженную эпидемиологическую обстановку.7. Увеличится число случаев заболевания туляремией, псевдотуберкулёзом, лептоспирозом, листериозом и т.д. Носителями этих заболеваний могут быть зайцы, кролики, водяные крысы, полёвки.8. Будет нанесен ущерб сельскому хозяйству, в частности запасам и урожаю зерновых, что повлечет увеличение их стоимости.9. Грызуны нанесут ущерб сельхозтехнике: перегрызут электропроводки, шланги, испортят подушки сидений.10. Нашествие грызунов нанесет ущерб как поставщикам, так и потребителям, т.к. производители не смогут удовлетворить спрос на продукцию.11. Огромный ущерб будет причинен животноводческим хозяйствам. В курятниках, например, грызуны поедают яйца и цыплят.12. Сильный удар грызуны нанесут фермерским хозяйствам. Из-за вредителей еще до уборки погибает 20 % урожая, крысы грызут саженцы, объедают кору плодовых деревьев, что приводит к их гибели.

We demand to cancel and prohibit shooting foxes in Saratov Oblast, Russia which will be held from December 1 to December 31 this year.We ask you to support our petition. Don't be indifferent, 5 thousand lives are at stake. We have only one month...

About of situationMass-media are talking that 5 thousand foxes will be killed this winter in Saratov Oblast. The shooting allegedly doing for reduction their population. Population of this animals is about 12,5 thousands. In 2019 this number was much more.The government is talking that the reduction of this animals needs to control rabies virus. Killing foxes will be held over the month and will be end on December 31.

What reduction looks likeDuring the shooting hunters set a trap for fox, they filling the fox hole, place traps in area where animals are looking for food. Foxes very often are killed in burrows together with their cubs. Usually in winter, sometimes hunters shoot from snowmobiles.Perhaps they want to kill foxes because of their fur. Maybe the power or someone else wants to sell it. We don't know. This is not the first time in Saratov Oblast hunters kill foxes. It is regular practice in this region.

Why shooting foxes must be cancel and prohibitKilling foxes is cruel and senseless murder. There is no neccessity.Foxes feel unsafe because of killing their family. They leave from their habitat and come up to people and their cities. If the power want to prevent rabies virus, they need to give food with vaccine in fox habitats, not kill animals. It is common practice in all civilized world.If the reduction of fox population is so important for the power, they can catch this animals and transport them to other regions of Russia where population level is very very low. It is more easier than killing them.

Why this shooting is dangerousThis shooting break ecosystem in the area. If the number of animals go down, rodent population will be increase. Rodents are dangerous vectors which can damaging not only ecology, but also economy and health.

The subject of the final series is global warming and climate change, and reflects on some effects of human impact on the natural world.

Discovery Channel prides itself on revealing the mysteries and unseen worlds of our planet. The Climate Change episode has the potential to move a lot of people, from one of the leading nations in global emissions, towards greater stewardship of this precious earth. This move acts in defiance of Discovery Channel's original aims, which was to inspire the public about the world around them. The American public has a right to be inspired.

Support and End Bias Hate Crime, Stop State Corruption, and reform New Jersey today!","['U.S. House of Representatives', 'Phil Murphy', 'Department of Justice', 'U.S. Senate', 'Cory A. Booker', 'Robert Menendez']",Sherry J,"New Jersey, United States",5824,"Jan 4, 2020",https://assets.change.org/photos/0/uj/nc/SWUjNcsoLwEUIah-800x450-noPad.jpg?1578154281,"While it is a known fact any victim residing in the United States today should never be the subject of retaliation, harassment, and/or be imposed by threats of revictimization by their offenders, this is not the case among victims of bias hate crime, orchestrated by law enforcement in New Jersey, with the State refusing to investigate, and charge.

These individuals have been brutally, and/or sadistically victimized at the hands of their aggressors, in the absence of rightful criminal prosecution against their attackers, in an attempt to successfully ‘subjugate’ innocent persons (as if a minority ‘person’ is ‘land’), deliberately perpetuating covert racism, and preserving the inherent discriminatory thread in Monmouth County, and across New Jersey, when slavery ended over 150 years ago.

Between 2015-2019, I was the victim of several aggravated assaults by law enforcement at Neptune City Police, partnered with harassment and bullying by Long Branch Police, and Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office.

This began in 2014-2015, when Joanne Jodry (Caucasian, 55) began stalking and harassing me; I went to the police, and signed complaints.

Joanne, in retaliation, indicated she felt pressed to speak to Keith Mitchell at Neptune City again, after she became increasingly concerned she would catch a felony for her actions.

Joanne obtained a family picture of me (31), with my niece (who is white, and was 4 years old in the photo), and my dog, from my website; she lied to Keith and told him my niece was her daughter, and that my dog was her dog. Joanne also told Keith that she believed I suffered from mental illness.

Keith, in the absence of Keith speaking to me, and based on my family picture, signed a complaint against me for harassment, and disorderly conduct (since dismissed).

From there, in a nutshell (and still in the absence of speaking to me), Keith Mitchell and Michael Vollbrecht both of Neptune City, drove to my apartment, called Monmouth Medical for a psychiatric screen, performed an illegal search on my apartment without a search warrant, or probable cause, when I was at work, all based on my race, and my family picture.

Keith then called Long Branch Police, and told a detective at Long Branch to ‘pick me up’ if they see me.

Sometime in between, Joanne and Keith spoke again where Joanne admitted to Keith that while she knew my niece was not her daughter, ‘she felt’ the picture of me, with my niece, personified the relationship between Joanne and her daughter.

Yet still in spite, a couple days later, I was violently assaulted by Keith, and Michael on my college campus (in graduate school), and transported to Monmouth Medical, where I was restrained by Michael, and hospital security, stripped naked, and force injected sedatives and psychotropics for several months, with no knowledge of what was happening, or why that transpired.

The re-victimization and retaliation by Neptune City Police, Long Branch Police, and Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office, continued to this day, the more I pressed forward to hold all individuals accountable.

Recently (and concurrently), after being told by a detective at Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office that 'they are aware of the criminal acts against me (by individuals, and law enforcement), they refuse to investigate', as well as being harassed by the current Director, and lieutenant of the Department of Professional Responsibility at the Prosecutor’s Office, I found out there were also no BWC’s, and no ‘perceived’ recorded victim statements by my aggressor.

The Prosecutor’s Office then supplanted the MVR as evidence, to attest to the actions of Keith Mitchell, when in the absence of the BWC’s, and recorded statements, it confirms this incident was bias crime.

Now, the Office of the Attorney General has mismanaged my complaints in the absence of proper escalation or entrusting my complaint to another State Prosecutor’s Office, or legitimate policing faction, to investigate.

Additionally, I have also yet to hear back from Mr. Gurbir Grewal, the Attorney General.

• When is it ever okay for a police department to effectuate search in someone’s home, in the absence of a search warrant, and probable cause?• How many other people has this happened to?• Why haven’t the officers who committed the crimes been collared?• Where is the money coming from to support these factions illegal policing practices?

And","['Chairman Martin B. Delgra III', 'Honorable Justices']",George Royeca,"Makati, Philippines",174439,6 Jul 2018,https://assets.change.org/photos/0/tz/se/FFTZSeuVmqdKfAI-800x450-noPad.jpg?1544782519,"Help #SaveAngkas and support the Filipino riding public

On December 12, 2018, the Supreme Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against a previous RTC injunction that prevented the LTFRB from apprehending Angkas riders. The TRO does NOT suspend Angkas' operations, but merely allows the LTFRB to once again apprehend Angkas bikers if they choose to do so.

The LTFRB, through various channels, has made clear its intent to crackdown on Angkas bikers, citing a very narrow interpretation of the law, and its supposed lack of options to aid Angkas and its bikers. Yet we have on various occasions presented the LTFRB with various options to move forward together.

Last December 2017, Angkas voluntarily suspended its operations to dialogue with the LTFRB. We proposed a pilot program of the Angkas service with the very purpose of determining its feasibility for the Metro under the agency's close watch and supervision. The proposal was declined despite evidence presented of our safety track record and the genuine service we were able to provide to hundreds of thousands of commuters.

Then in May 2018, Congressional committee on Metro Manila Development chaired by Hon. Winston ""Winnie"" T. Castelo urged the LTFRB to include Motorcycle Taxis as a type of TNVS, citing the precedent of the LTFRB allowing private 4-wheeled vehicles to be used for passenger services as in the cases of Uber and Grab. They were given 30 days to review the legal and regulatory implications of such a move, yet no action was taken.

The LTFRB has, on at least 2 occasions, passed up the chance to work with Congress and the private sector to provide safe and efficient transport alternatives to Filipinos, despite having numerous setbacks and delays in their own efforts to modernize mass transport systems in the country.

Thus far the LTFRB continues to insist that motorcycles are unfit for passenger transport due to safety issues, yet has consistently ignored Angkas' safety record as well as proof of the precautions it takes to ensure passenger safety, including biker training, quality helmets, and accident insurance.

Angkas' safety record currently stands at 99.997%, above and beyond the rates cited by government agencies to claim otherwise. It is a testament not only to the viability of using motorcycles for safe passenger services, but also of the massive improvements that a single committed organization can make to professionalize an industry.

The LTFRB continues to insist that safety is its top priority, yet we beg to insist otherwise: their first priority should be moving the Filipino people, then figuring out how to make them safe while doing so.

Habal-habal has been around for decades, and will continue to exist so long as Filipinos continue to lack decent transport options. And while the LTFRB insists their crackdowns will fix this dismal situation, we ourselves have already trained and educated over 70,000 motorcycle drivers – free of charge - all over the country in less than 2 years.

There are over 14 million motorcycle drivers all over the Philippines, most without any formal training. Only by working together can we hope to make more of them better and safer, without having to take away their only means of transportation.

435,Libérez ma mère des camps de concentration en Chine !,". Pour principale cause, notre identité, notre culture, notre existence...
Je n’ai encore jamais parlé",['Pétition adressée à Emmanuel Macron'],Gulhumar HAITIWAJI,France,458401,Date de création 27 nov. 2018,https://assets.change.org/photos/4/uv/qt/FhUvQtjYFUIFkNn-800x450-noPad.jpg?1543319919,"Bonjour, je m'appelle Gulhumar, j'ai 26 ans et je suis française. Voici mon histoire:

Ma mère a été appelée par son ex patron en Chine en novembre 2016 pour signer les soi-disant documents de sa demande de retraite. Après 1 semaine d’hésitation et de pression de son ex patron, elle a pris des billets aller-retour de 2 semaines. Dès son arrivée là-bas, elle s’est rendue à son bureau et a eu la surprise d’y retrouver des gendarmes. On l’a immédiatement mise en garde à vue et confisqué son passeport. Ma mère a eu extrêmement peur car elle n’avait rien fait ! Pendant 2 mois, elle a été interdite de sortir de la région.

Le 29 janvier 2017 ma mère a été officiellement arrêtée et disparue... plus aucune nouvelle d’elle jusqu’en juillet 2017 où la Chine nous a confirmé que ma mère a été internée dans un camp de « rééducation » le 9 juin 2017. Aucune information sur ce qui s’est passé entre janvier et juin et où est-ce qu’elle a été. Connaissant la Chine, nous sommes persuadés qu’elle a subit des interrogatoires à rallonge dans une prison et même pire, des tortures. Lorsqu’elle a rejoint le camp, elle a eu droit à un coup de fil. La seule chose qu’elle a demandé à sa famille était de lui amener des sous-vêtements et des affaires propres...

Aujourd'hui, elle est toujours dans un camp et n’a le droit qu’à une visite par mois avec sa mère pendant laquelle elle doit dire qu’elle va très bien. Nous cependant, moi, mon père et ma soeur qui vivons en France, n’avons aucun droit de communiquer avec elle. On devait donc croire ce que ma grand-mère nous racontait au téléphone, jusqu’au mois de mai où elle m’a suppliée de ne plus l'appeler, en pleurs. La police l’avait « embêtée toute une journée la veille et elle ne comprenait pas ce qu’elle avait fait pour mériter cela ».

Voici ce qui est arrivé chez moi. Avec des millions de cas comme celui-ci, ce sont d'innombrables vie détruites. Pour principale cause, notre identité, notre culture, notre existence...

Je n’ai encore jamais parlé publiquement de ce qui se passait dans ma région natale. Peut-être par peur de provoquer la pitié et toutes sortes de commentaires de compassion, et surtout par peur d’attirer des ennuis à ma mère depuis son incarcération dans un camp de concentration... Je me suis tue pendant très longtemps et au vu du soutien de mon entourage, je ne suis plus capable de rester silencieuse plus longtemps. Ces camps ont ouvert en 2016. Officiellement appelé des ""camps de rééducation politique"", ils enferme plus de 3 millions de personnes actuellement.

Je prie tous les lecteurs de prendre conscience du processus intensifié d'assimilation et de discrimination depuis des décennies dans la région.

Aidez-moi à faire libérer ma mère, incarcérée de façon totalement arbitraire en Chine. Son crime ? Etre une Ouighoure et de ce fait, faire partie d’une ethnie minoritaire, parmi tant d’autres, souffrant du pouvoir communiste et totalitaire du régime en place.

#ActionforAlbert

Albert Thompson*, 63 years old, has lived in London for 44 years. He has prostate cancer. After major surgery, he arrived for his first radiotherapy session to be taken aside and told that unless he can prove he is legally entitled to live in the UK he will have to pay the full £54,000 for his treatment upfront.

For 3 decades, Albert has paid taxes to the British Government. He arrived from Jamaica as a teenager. He has no money and he needs our help.

That’s why I’m calling for the Home Office to deal with Albert’s status in the UK so his treatment can be approved right away.

Cancer doesn’t wait.

Having been a primary carer for loved ones who have had cancer, I know that it is expensive, frightening and depressing. People who do not have a lot of savings or support from elsewhere struggle massively financially, and Albert has been unable to work for some years now due to cancer so has nothing. Even with appropriate support, cancer is a lonely and terrifying journey. I can't imagine the despair that this man must be feeling right now.

This is part of a much wider issue too, of people who originally came from Commonwealth countries now not being recognised as legal citizens - despite living in our country for many, many years and contributing in the same way we do. Let's stand up for their rights - and stand up to the increasingly harsh landscape that the Home Office is creating for innocent people that are relying on their country's support at the hardest times in their lives.

Please sign and share this petition.

It's using plants to create products to help ensure food security to feed starving people, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve the healthfulness of foods, and end the cruel treatment of animals.

Unilever, a UK-based 60 billion dollar multinational corporation, filed a lawsuit confessing that Hampton Creek is taking away market share from a couple of its products: Hellmann's and Best Foods. Thus, as Unilever admits, it's attempting to rely on an archaic standard of identity regulation that was created before World War II to mandate that Hampton Creek removes its products from store shelves.

Unilever is not only contributing to these problems by using inhumane, unsustainable, and unhealthy ingredients, but rather than solving important global issues, is trying to prevent others from doing so.   As an example, even purchasing just one jar of Hampton Creek's ""Just Mayo"" instead of Best Foods/Hellmann's saves land and water usage, reduces CO2 emissions, eliminates hundreds of milligrams of cholesterol.

When a 60 billion dollar company flexes its muscles to prevent a good-for-the-world startup company from succeeding, there are only two words for that: corporate bullying.

Please sign this petition. This cannot be passed. It is wrong, unfair and it is discrimination. It prevents a developing human from being able to truly realise their full potential and their true selves because of ignorant and uneducated people in power. We are a progressive society and we welcome all kinds of gender identity and sexualities and this should be celebrated, not hidden in the closet anymore, especially in such a safe and accepting space where children spend most of their developing years. A school should be welcoming, supportive and encouraging of all kinds of gender identity and sexuality not frowned upon or ignored."

Il apparaît que cette plainte a été classée sans suite et semble particulièrement infondée.

Malgré la demande de l’autorité hiérarchique supérieure de ne pas communiquer sur ce drame, l’ensemble du corps enseignant a spontanément manifesté sa solidarité vis-à-vis des proches et des collègues de Jean Willot par différentes actions : affichages, minute de silence, manifestation à Eaubonne, condoléances en ligne, expressions sur les réseaux sociaux. Un syndicat demande l’ouverture d’une enquête.

Monsieur Le Ministre  de l’Education, qui affirme vouloir assurer notre protection de manière très générale, ne semble pas vouloir réagir à ce drame, ni proposer une quelconque solution pour faire en sorte que « Plus Jamais ça ».

Devant la multiplication de ces plaintes qui entachent très gravement la relation enseignant-parent, qui nuisent à la qualité de notre travail, et qui peuvent engendrer de graves conséquences négatives à titre personnel, nous souhaitons une réaction forte de l’Etat, notre employeur.

Nous vous demandons donc, Madame La Ministre, d’utiliser tous vos pouvoirs pour que  Le Parquet poursuive  les  parents d’élèves concernés  pour dénonciation calomnieuse contre des enseignants.

Nous vous demandons de transformer  en acte les discours du Ministre de l’Education, Monsieur Blanquer. paroles exprimées lors du vote sur la « loi pour la confiance ».

Our farmers are crippling under the strain and we need to do more to support them. I see so many community groups joining force to supply donated goods to keep our farmers going but I want to see more from our government.

I understand it's a national problem and it's far and wide, you can't make it rain but our farming community is the backbone to our country.

Right now in some states we have a subsidy for the cost of transporting donated fodder however that is expecting a very proud farmer to ask for help.

I know that we would get more help to our farmers if we could have farmers buy supplies and our government subsidise the transport. Drought doesn't just have an impact on the livestock, it also impacts the mental health of our farmers, their families and the surrounding community. With stock feed reducing across the country, transport costs are fast becoming the biggest issue impacting farmers trying to stay afloat.

Tell our government that we need a NATIONAL DISASTER FUND created to help support our country in crisis because right now our farmers need our help.

Let's also get a transport subsidy setup so that farmers don't need to just rely on donations but they can also get purchased stock feed delivered to them and not pay full freight.

Once used primarily as a tabletop sweetener, alternative sweeteners are now everywhere in the food supply – things like bread, cereal, granola bars, yogurt, ice cream, milk and children’s beverages.

But it’s virtually impossible for me to know what sugar substitutes are in my food and why. That’s because the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) rules for labeling these ingredients are outdated and inadequate.

For instance, what are ingredients like Xylitol, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysates, Saccharin, Acesulfame Potassium, Neotame, Isomalt and Lactitol, and why are they in my food? It’s hard to tell because the FDA only requires food manufacturers to list the chemical name of these ingredients on my food labels. It’s also hard for me to know if products marketed as reduced sugar are actually better for me and my family because these claims are often misleading. Oftentimes, I think I’m just getting a product with less sugar, but it turns out I’m also unexpectedly getting sugar substitutes too! An even crazier example is when products such as popular brands’ “Reduced Sugar” peanut butters actually have more calories than the regular versions!

I want to know what’s in my food. I want to trust the information on food labels. That is why we need complete, clear, simple, easy to use and understand information about alternative sweeteners in our food and we need it now.

I urge the FDA to enact sweeping, meaningful reform of sugar substitute labeling on food packages now, so that all consumers have complete and transparent information about alternative sweeteners in their food.

Businesses have been closed and workers have been off the job for weeks, reducing the city's tax revenue significantly. The Office of the Department of Finance projects that without any changes the city would have a $649 million deficit next year. The city cannot legally operate with a deficit. We understand that hard decisions needed to be made and that cut backs and program budget reductions were inevitable. However, to completely eliminate an office that supports a vital industry in the city of Philadelphia, especially one that has been hit very hard during this crisis, is short sighted and should be reversed.

In the new budget, the Office of Arts, Culture, and the Creative Economy was budgeted $0 dollars, down from approximately $4.4 million, effectively closing the office. Most of that budgeted money goes directly to the Philadelphia Cultural Fund, which gives grants to hundreds of non-profits in the city.

The presentation of the budget by the Mayor is only the first step. It still must be approved and voted on by City Council before July 1.

SEE: Mayor's Operating Budget - re: page 80SEE: Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney Delivers New Budget by Video; Jobs/Services Cuts, Tax Hikes

According to the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance, the arts and cultural sector generates $4.1 billion in economic impact annually and supports 55,000 jobs. That creates $1.3 billion in household income and $224.3 million in state and local taxes.* The creative economy includes but is not limited to artists, musicians, painters, sculptors, dancers, actors, filmmakers, graphic designers, venues, theaters, museums, galleries, bartenders, waiters, chefs, box office workers, bouncers, sound engineers, tech crews, art/dance/recording studios, and all employed by those entities, as well as support industries such as accountants, lawyers, hotels, ride shares, parking, public relations, marketing, and media. On the other side there are the fans, patrons, concert goers, theater attendees, and more who support the arts and make the purchases.

Most of this industry has been shut down during this crisis and needs support now more than ever to rebound during the economic recovery.

The Office of Arts, Culture, and the Creative Economy's mission is to close the gap in access to quality cultural experiences and creative expression through the support and promotion of arts, culture and the creative industries; connecting Philadelphians to enriching, arts-infused experiences; linking local artists and cultural organizations to resources and opportunities; and preserving the City’s public art assets. http://creativephl.org

The OACCE is also responsible for the Music Industry Task Force, the Mayor's Cultural Advisory Council, Art in City Hall, all of Philadelphia's public art, and funding the Philadelphia Cultural Fund which gives grants to numerous Philadelphia arts and culture non-profits.

Philadelphia is a vibrant city teeming with culture that has been driving our identity for hundreds of years. The art created in Philadelphia reaches well beyond its borders and has touched the world and helps drive our other industries through attention and attraction to our area. As we look to rebound and recover from this crisis, there are certainly sectors that are essential to our health and safety and must be prioritized. However, unless we take care to ensure our cultural health is also revived, we risk losing our spirit.

Philadelphia's creative economy deserves proper representation in City Hall. Understandably, it is likely not possible for the OACCE to be budgeted at the same level as the original budget, however, the industry's economic impact alone justifies that the office's budget be more than zero. We are simply asking that the City of Philadelphia Office of Arts, Culture, and the Creative Economy not be eliminated.

Re: Make housing decent and affordable for all!

Dear Commissioner Schmit,

I am writing with regards to the concerns raised by rapporteur van Sparrentak’s report on decent and affordable housing, which recently has been adopted. The report has emphasised that many Europeans are living in unhealthy, low quality, energy-poor, or overcrowded spaces, with many facing evictions and homelessness, aggravated by the ongoing pandemic. Increasingly more households are overburdened by housing costs and deprived of housing. Housing deprivation is at the heart of poverty and social exclusion and closely linked with unemployment.

Many citizens were given a voice by the European Citizen’s Initiative “Housing for All”, and now the Parliament has agreed and stressed the urgency for a common housing strategy and now we ask of you to take the report to heart and to act accordingly. The housing crisis has been present for years and is now severely aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Improve housing conditions, create a framework that enables sustainable and long-term investments into housing, regulate short-term rentals to prevent further extraction of housing stock from the market. Please help not only me but all the EU’s citizens to put a roof over our head and to maintain it.

Help us better our future!

Yours sincerely,

[Your name]

Thank you so much for your support and let's keep on fighting for housing for all!

This is a Petition from the People of Goa. We exercise our rights for clean air, water, land and food and therefore are against the expansion of the Mormugao Port for Coal.   World over, governments are switching from Coal to more cleaner and efficient fuels for energy to control pollution and slow down climate change. Countries are reducing toxic effluents into air, water and soil. Indian industries and political clout needs to heed to these urgent needs of our times, and join this movement. We hope that Goa sets the precedent not only in Clean Energy but also in leading the way for dealing with and reducing toxic by-products and effluents of all kinds of industrial activities.

The current plans of expansion of the Mormugao port suggests that coal will be imported for a Jindal steel plant in Karnataka and electricity production by Adani. These plans are being undertaken without a thorough assessment of the environmental impacts. In fact the current EIA is highly contentious and shows clearly that the concerned Environmental authorities have not given the EIA enough support. Given that we are a democracy, the rights of the People must come first. Various speakers including activists, ecologists, fishermen, students, businessmen, and members of various political parties including the ruling party, cited numerous oppositions during the eight days of Public Hearing at Tilak Maidan, Vasco-Goa regarding the expansion of coal handling facilities at MPT. The Port expansion and its connected activities can also adversely affect marine tourism and fishing – two major source of livelihoods here. But the concerned authorities did not engage them in the decision making, before giving this expansion a green signal.

At present, even though the activity is on a lesser scale, people are already facing health consequences and fish is on the decline. The shoreline is disappearing and the illegal dredging is causing fears of landslides. Additionally, mangroves, lands and hills will be sacrificed to enhance this facility to handle more coal in the form of road and rail expansions.MPT has drawn a contract with the said corporates for 30 years, risking the lives of not only the people in the vicinity but all along the transportation belt. Therefore, I would like to request the you to deny permission and in fact ban, even the present on-going activity, as the project proponents seem to have knowingly flouted rules and regulations, brazenly jeopardizing the lives of people around, (including their own workers) causing atmospheric pollution, water pollution and a bio-diversity hazard. With advancements in technology we are now in a position where we can easily switch to more viable forms of energy instead of relying on conventional fuels that cause irreversible harm to the eco-system.Do we want our children and our next generations to be affected with physical deformities and struggling for fresh air and water? Think.Say No To Coal, Now.Ban all coal projects in Goa, before it’s too late. Peace and Love.Sign the Petition and Share it.

The objective of this petition is to ensure a fast-track and impartial trial for Rajesh and Nupur Talwar re-examining the entire evidence available from a neutral point of view.
The rest of this petition would be a very high level summary so that most of you can read and form a judgement of your own. In the end, there are more links in case you want to see more details.
What happened: Rajesh and Nupur Talwar's daughter and help were murdered, after several years of back and forth and a lengthy trial, the Talwars were sent to prison for life. (Read more on wiki)
Below are some of the main things which are difficult to digest:
1. Narco/ lie detector tests: Talwars showed no deception, while the three servants (allegedly present in the house on the day of the murder) did. In the narco, the servants gave a chilling blow-by-blow account of the murder, their motives, along with mentioning khukri as the murder weapon. Agreed that narco is not admissible to prosecute the servants, but why in the world is it not admissible to exonerate Talwars? Didn't we forever say that even if 100 guilty escape punishment, no innocent should be punished?
2. Closure report: CBI had submitted a closure report saying that though they believed Talwars are guilty, they didn't have enough evidence to prosecute them and hence wanted to close the case. Talwars challenged this closure report and went to court requesting a re-investigation. Which criminal does that? Ask for more investigation when he/she has a chance to go scot free?
3. People in the house: CBI claims that there were only four people in the house and hence Talwars are the murderers. Booze bottles in Hemraj's room point out the possibility of three other servants being in the room that night (who were suspects at some stage). This is discarded saying servants wont have guts to drink while the master was in the house. Seriously? We work and investigate on such logic?
4. Murder weapon: The khukri mentioned in the narco was actually found in the room of one of the servants with tiny blood traces on it (however it could not be established if it was human or not). On the other hand, no scalpel (allegedly murder weapon) was ever produced in the court. Also, the golf club supposedly used by them to inflict the injury was found and handed over to the CBI by the Talwars. Which criminal does that?
5. Motive for murder: The Talwar's motive hinges on Aarushi and Hemraj being found in a 'compromising position'. However, as per CBI's closure report there was no trace of Hemraj anywhere in Aarushi's room. Did the Talwars manage to differentiate between Hemraj's and Aarushi's blood while cleaning up (latter was found in the room)? They were smart enough to clean that but forgot blood marks on the terrace wall and the whisky bottle?

I am not claiming that person A or person B is or is not the murderer. My only claim is that given so much fuzziness how can we say that Talwars are the murders ""beyond a reasonable doubt""? The logic/evidence provided is far away from being able to overcome the presumption ""innocent until proven guilty"". In my mind it tends to lean more towards ""innocent and not guilty"".

A study to guide the design and possible implementation of a proposed public transport transport facility.   This erf belongs to City Parks and Zoo and is zoned public open space.  Sunninghill halted.

A study to guide the design and possible implementation of a proposed public transport facility in or near the existing Sunninghill taxi facility (including Paulshof) is being carried out by the Johannesburg Development Agency.  Two options for Sunninghill have been put forward.  Upgrading the existing taxi facility or using land (public open space)  designated for a Park.

Petition against using Portion 513, Farm Rietfontein 2-IR (formally known as erf 87, Sunninghill) as a Public Transport facility

The purpose of this petition is to prevent anyone from using the above mentioned erf that has already been allocated to be used and developed as a park, for the use as a public transport facility.   This erf belongs to City Parks and Zoo and is zoned public open space.  Sunninghill Community has entered into an Adopt a Park agreement with City Parks and has already, with monies donated and sponsorship by residents and businesses begun work on this project.

Increased vehicle traffic, literally hundreds of vehicles including busses etc will severely impact the noise levels in the suburban area, and will also put pressure on roads (specifically Leeukop road) which is a small single lane road that already experiences traffic congestion.

This part of Sunninghill has no public open spaces but has high density residential dwellings and commercial office parks.

A park which is secure with security measures, jogging and cycling tracks, benches, playground equipment and more will add huge value to our resident’s lives.  It will also secure the value of residential and commercial investments. The public open space is also home to our local birdlife and animal life and has a wetland as part of it with protected indigenous trees.  Johannesburg’s green belts need to be protected and secured.

The process of converting the land into a park has already begun and should not be halted. The existing taxi holding area should be upgraded to accommodate the Public transport facility.

We urgently need your support as time is of great importance.

Please give your support by signing this petition and raise awareness by telling your friends.

BACKGROUND
During the February 18, 2015 explosion at the Torrance refinery, a flying 80,000 lb. piece of equipment slammed down at 60 MPH just 5 ft. from a tank with 50,000 lb. of modified hydrofluoric acid (MHF). Federal safety officials say the surrounding communities ""dodged a bullet.” The Chemical Safety Board says that accident could have been catastrophic. 
One of the world’s most dangerous industrial chemicals, hydrofluoric acid (HF), is used in massive quantities in only two California refineries, Torrance and the Valero in Wilmington. The eight other CA refineries with alkylation units use a much safer alternative — sulfuric acid. HF refineries claim an additive mixed in with the HF makes it safe. But with only one or two additive molecules per hundred molecules of MHF, it’s too little to make a difference.
“Modified” HF (MHF) is just as deadly as HF. If released, it forms a ground-hugging cloud that can drift for miles, causing death and injury. The refineries’ other mitigation measures, like water sprays and barriers, are also ineffective. Mass casualties can result from an MHF release — wind direction determines who dies. 
The US EPA has conducted a preliminary investigation into MHF http://bit.ly/2poBJro. The AQMD has reviewed innumerable technical documents from the refineries. (Chart 5, http://bit.ly/2wBHeUh)   Both this preliminary EPA inspection report and the initial AQMD staff recommendations were that MHF risk is assumed identical to HF risk. The US Chemical Safety Board and Department of Justice have sued ExxonMobil to get proprietary information on MHF. 
The 2015 accident could have created an HF plume large enough to cause 16 miles of serious irreversible injuries. Death would be possible within the first 8 miles. In 2015 the air was moving to the WSW so the plume would have headed out to sea. People would have died all the way to the Redondo Beach pier. Twenty three schools lie within the main debris field left by the explosion. Even if emergency systems kept 90% of the tank’s acid from escaping, the remaining 5,000 lb. acid plume would have been large enough to kill people nearly all the way to the beach.
The EPA's, CSB’s, and AQMD’s MHF investigations are due to activism and scientific sleuthing by local residents, who joined forces in the Torrance Refinery Action Alliance (TRAA). Local scientists on our Advisory Panel discovered MHF is over 98% HF by molecule count and behaves exactly like HF at normal refinery operating temperatures and pressures. http://bit.ly/2p6dPCn The industry has been lying to us for 27 years. MHF is no safer than HF. Yet, industry is still lying. 
It’s up to us, the residents. The South Bay must not accept the status of “sacrifice zone” to benefit PBF in Torrance and Valero in Wilmington, or to avoid a short one-time disruption during the transition.

Writing and passing VAWA is one of the legislative accomplishments of which I’m most proud. VAWA has transformed the way our country responds to violence against women. And, with each re-authorization, the Congress has expanded VAWA’s provisions on a bipartisan basis to improve protections, including for Native American women and survivors from underserved communities, and improve efforts to prevent intimate partner violence.

While we have made significant progress, there is still much work to do. As many as 1 in 3 women are subjected to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking at some point in their lives, and the rate is even higher for women of color, Native American women, and members of the LGBTQ community. Growing evidence shows that COVID-19 has only exacerbated the threat of intimate partner violence, creating a pandemic within a pandemic for countless women at risk for abuse. In short, this is an urgent crisis.

This should not be a Democratic or Republican issue — it’s about standing up against the abuse of power and preventing violence. I am grateful to the House of Representatives for their leadership and dedication to ending gender-based violence. Now, I urge the Senate to follow past precedent and bring a strong bipartisan coalition together to ensure the passage of VAWA so that I can sign this legislation as soon as possible.

President Joe Biden !!!

Aplauso a la Cámara de Representantes por aprobar la Ley de Reautorización de Violencia contra las Mujeres (VAWA) con apoyo bipartidista, e insto al Senado a seguir su ejemplo para renovar y fortalecer esta ley histórica.

Escribir y aprobar VAWA es uno de los logros legislativos de los que estoy más orgulloso. VAWA ha transformado la forma en que nuestro país responde a la violencia contra las mujeres. Y, con cada reautorización, el Congreso ha ampliado las disposiciones de VAWA sobre una base bipartidista para mejorar las protecciones, incluso para las mujeres nativas americanas y sobrevivientes de comunidades desatendidas, y mejorar los esfuerzos para prevenir la violencia de pareja íntima.

Si bien hemos logrado avances importantes, todavía queda mucho trabajo por hacer. Hasta 1 de cada 3 mujeres son sometidas a violencia doméstica, violencia en el noviazgo, agresión sexual y acoso en algún momento de sus vidas, y la tasa es aún mayor para las mujeres de color, las mujeres nativas americanas y los miembros de la comunidad LGBTQ. La creciente evidencia muestra que COVID-19 solo ha exacerbado la amenaza de violencia por parte de la pareja íntima, creando una pandemia dentro de una pandemia para innumerables mujeres en riesgo de abuso. En resumen, esta es una crisis urgente.

459,Stand Against Food Waste in Colorado,"Forty percent of all the food produced annually in the United States will be wasted. Of that, a quarter is discarded by grocery stores when the food is not immediately sold. In 2008, that quarter shiny, instead of being thrown out, it could be shipped out to food banks.
Ours is a world where people starve, where many metric tons of perfectly good food in developed countries like the United States go straight to the trash. Yet, even with all this abundance, 1 in 8 Americans are facing food",['Michael Bennet'],Brandon Reimers,United States,16796,"Dec 7, 2016",https://assets.change.org/photos/8/wg/qc/rhwGqcsMaevcSwh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1530328428,"Forty percent of all the food produced annually in the United States will be wasted. Of that, a quarter is discarded by grocery stores when the food is not immediately sold. In 2008, that quarter amounted to forty-three billion pounds. When an apple’s skin has lost its luster and is no longer as shiny, instead of being thrown out, it could be shipped out to food banks.

Ours is a world where people starve, where many metric tons of perfectly good food in developed countries like the United States go straight to the trash. Yet, even with all this abundance, 1 in 8 Americans are facing food insecurity. That number even translates to Colorado where 1 in 8 Coloradans do not know when their next meal will be.

We must mandate that food retailers partner with food banks and homeless shelters in order to reduce the amount of edible food being wasted.

Instead of disposing of food approaching its sell-by dates or produce that has sat for a couple of days, it must be supplied to food banks or other charitable donation centers. To do this, a law must be introduced in the Colorado legislature.

There are already several relevant precedents which we can look upon for guidance.

The 1976 Tax Reform Act, among other things, “entitled” corporations to tax deductions, provided that they make a “contribution [...] of appreciated property” to a charity or other foundation.

This means that retailers have little to lose financially in donating undesired food, as the government would, perhaps upon filing a claim, grant those tax deductions to the retailers that use this measure to their benefit.

That Act has been out in the public sphere, without much mention or recognition, for forty years.

Meanwhile, France has already passed a law mandating that supermarkets donate unsold food (food still retaining good quality but which is approaching its best-before date). With this law in place, more meals will be dished out each year to the needy and the poor.

If we want to help stop food waste, we need to start the trend ourselves. Colorado is in a position to lead this change.  Let us all petition our lawmakers to create a food reclamation act and put the issue on the map for other states looking to do the same thing.

460,Best Western: la vacanza crudele,". Sebbene Animal Equality ed Open Wing Alliance apprezzino questo gesto da parte dell'azienda, è da",['Petizione diretta a Best Western'],Animal Equality Italia,"Milano, Italia",63846,Data di lancio 4 giu 2019,https:https://static.change.org/images/default-petition-darker.gif,"Best Western è una delle più grandi catene di hotel al mondo. Con 16 diversi marchi unici ed oltre 4.200 hotel dislocati in più di 100 paesi, Best Western è una famiglia di hotel mondiale pluripremiata, che vuole trasmettere ai propri clienti l’immagine di un’azienda garanzia di professionalità e trasparenza.

Sulla pagina aziendale italiana non mancano i numerosi riferimenti a premi e riconoscimenti ottenuti dalla catena alberghiera e alla professionalità della propria leadership. L’azienda tiene molto anche a dimostrare il proprio impegno sociale, e a tal proposito cita numerose iniziative benefiche e programmi filantropici che sostiene in tutto il mondo. Non mancano neppure gli accenni all’importanza data ad un soddisfacente rapporto di fiducia con i clienti.

Nonostante l’evidente cura dimostrata nel posizionarsi come un’azienda etica ed attenta a questioni di carattere sociale, che sul sito aziendale italiano non esiste alcuna menzione da parte di Best Western sulla sua policy relativa al benessere animale in relazione alle proprie filiere di approvvigionamento e, in particolar modo, non vi è cenno circa la provenienza delle uova utilizzate nei loro ristoranti.

In seguito alla campagna iniziata da Open Wing Alliance, Best Western Hotel and Resorts ha pubblicato sul proprio sito americano un primo impegno a prendere le distanze dalle uova di galline allevate in gabbia. Sebbene Animal Equality ed Open Wing Alliance apprezzino questo gesto da parte dell'azienda, è da notarsi che l'impegno pubblicato non soddisfa le richieste della coalizione. In concreto, la politica aziendale pubblicata manca di alcune nozioni fondamentali:

1. Nella politica, non viene specificato se la stessa di applichi a tutti i marchi di proprietà e gestiti da Best Western.

2. Nella politica non viene specificato se la stessa si applichi sia alle uova in guscio, che agli ovoprodotti.

3. Nella politica non viene specificato se Best Western si impegni a riferire periodicamente e pubblicamente lo stato del processo di distanziamento dagli allevamenti in gabbia

Più di 1500 aziende in tutto il mondo, fra cui i diretti concorrenti Marriott International, Four Seasons and Resort, Accor Hotels, InterContinental Hotels e Hilton hanno dimostrato di voler fare la loro parte per ridurre la sofferenza degli animali, pubblicando il proprio impegno globale a non utilizzare uova che provengono da allevamenti in cui le galline sono costrette in gabbia, con politiche aziendali chiare e trasparenti che comprendono tutti gli elementi che al momento mancano nella politica di Best Western.

Le galline allevate in gabbia vivono in spazi talmente angusti e sovraffollati da non riuscire ad esprimere quasi nessuno dei loro comportamenti naturali. Costrette a mantenersi in equilibrio su una rete metallica, soffrono spesso di gravi malformazioni alle zampe, le quali rimangono spesso incastrate al pavimento. Incapaci di muoversi e di raggiungere il cibo e l’acqua, alcune galline muoiono in una lenta agonia, schiacciate dalle compagne di gabbia.

Confinare le galline in gabbia costringendole ad una vita di terribili sofferenze è sbagliato ed infatti sempre più consumatori attenti scelgono aziende che hanno già preso una posizione chiara e trasparente al riguardo, le quali hanno deciso di pubblicare il proprio impegno di modo che possa essere liberamente consultabile dai consumatori.

Per questo motivo chiediamo a Best Western di dimostrarsi all’altezza delle aspettative dei propri clienti e di un mercato sempre più sensibile al benessere degli animali, pubblicando un impegno globale, completo e trasparente a non utilizzare uova provenienti da galline allevate in gabbia che sia valido per tutti i loro marchi, che specifichi che copre uova in guscio ed ovoprodotti, e che stabilisca una data precisa per l’implementazione della politica. Inoltre chiediamo a Best Western di tradurre questo impegno per renderlo fruibile ai consumatori di tutti i paesi in cui Best Western opera, e di impegnarsi a rendere pubblico il progresso nell'implementazione della politica.

461,Stop sterilizing Indigenous women without consent,"and as recently as 2017, Indigenous women report being forcibly or coercively sterilized. Some women consented to a tubal ligation.
Forced and coerced sterilizations of Indigenous women are a result of systemic violence and discrimination against Indigenous peoples in the provision of public services in Canada, a pattern well known and acknowledged by government. They are an assault on Indigenous action to end sterilizations of Indigenous women without their consent. We ask Trudeau:

She does not remember signing a consent form, but remembers her upset husband saying, “I’m not signing that!” to medical staff. After the surgery, the doctor said, “cut, tied and burned. There. Nothing is getting through that.”

Across Canada and as recently as 2017, Indigenous women report being forcibly or coercively sterilized. Some women were incorrectly told the procedure is reversible. Others were separated from their babies until they consented to a tubal ligation.

Forced and coerced sterilizations of Indigenous women are a result of systemic violence and discrimination against Indigenous peoples in the provision of public services in Canada, a pattern well known and acknowledged by government. They are an assault on Indigenous women, their families, their communities, and their Nations that have already been subjected to forced assimilation through colonialism, including eugenic practices.

Sterilizing women without their free, full, and informed consent is a form of violence and torture. Measures to prevent births within ethnic or racial groups is explicitly prohibited by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

All women have the human right to make decisions around if, when, and how to create a family. All women have a right to live free from violence and discrimination. All women have a right to health.

We ask the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, to take immediate action to end sterilizations of Indigenous women without their consent. We ask Trudeau:

462,Dingo Conservation is Crucial for Biodiversity,"Ecological research around the world has increasingly emphasised the importance of apex predators for ecosystem health, and the preservation of biodiversity. Diminishing apex predator populations has often been associated with ecosystem instability and species decline.
The false dingo/’wild dog’ distinction in current government policiy in Australia obstructs policy recognition of this ecological reality.
The positive role of dingoes within Australian ecosystems as native wildlife is being undermined by use of lethal poisons to remove 'wild dogs' or dingoes,  and exotic non native predators,  to which dingoes are falling victim as collateral damage.
Australia's leading environmental  Scientists have endorsed removal of toxic poisons (such as 1080) from use and killing our Australian dingo  on environmental grounds.
Federal and State Governments must now  act to develop and implement policy which considers the important ecological and cultural identity of the dingo, and further develop alternative stock protection methodology wherever necessary, to avoid lethal control. 
The Scientific experts further emphasise mounting and compelling evidence that indiscriminate baiting of dingoes,  including as a consequence of collateral or secondary poisoning, exacerbates livestock predation and negative ecological consequences, and can seriously harm  biodiversity, resilience and health of Australian ecosystems
The impacts of  lethal control of dingoes  is likely to facilitate increases in wild cats, foxes and herbivore populations (kangaroos, feral goats, feral pigs, etc.)  that are currently managed as pest species.
Many of Australia’s threatened mammals survive in  areas where dingoes are present,  and an increase in intensity and frequency of poison baiting,  is likely to be detrimental to their persistence.
The reintroduction of dingoes to the environment  in Australia wherever populations have been removed and /or decimated,  as recommended by the Victorian State Government following its recent Inquiry into threatened species, must be acknowledged as only beneficial for biodiversity and acted upon in Victoria and all other  States and Territories of Australia must conduct similar inquiries to inform outcomes of benefit to the environment.   
As to exaggerated claims about dingoes and stock loss to predation, data obtained by AFCAD Inc under Freedom of Information from each State has shown that claims of stock loss  by dingoes, in all States of Australia,  is exaggerated and negligible.
These issues must  be fully addressed by both Commonwealth and State Governments and the use of lethal control abandoned in favour of non lethal measures without any further hesitation or delay and the reintroduction of dingoes to suitable areas be considered with priority.  To do otherwise is irresponsible

Aggressors' troops in large number come to Ukraine through belarus territory.Right now thousands of civilian people have died, fled, hide in bunkers or join Ukrainian armed forces, who courageously defend against the enemy. Invaders bomb cities, destroy houses, roads, infrastructure, attack commercial vessels, harm nature, blockade cities and deprive civilians from access to food and medicine.Yesterday March, 2nd the United Nations General Assembly resolution was passed with 141 nations condemning russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which clearly shows that the whole civilized world supports our country. Also, with the deepest gratitude we would like to thank President Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Government and people of Turkey for closing Bosphorus and Dardanelles strait for russian warships.Today, we address race directors of Samsung Bosphorus Cross-Continental Swimming Competition, Turkish Olympic Committee and Ministry of Youth and Sports. We ask you to join the International Olympic Committee and the biggest sports organizations like UEFA, FIFA, NHL, FINA, LEN, Oceanman, World Triathlon Organization, IRONMAN and others in their united position against russian invasion into Ukraine.As the recent research shows, about 70% of russians, who became the victims of propaganda, support this war. While russian and belarus swimmers train to cross the Bosphorus strait, russian troops cross Ukrainian borders to kill civilians and destroy our cities. Invaders troops come and bombs fall from the belarus territory. We request you to condemn russian invasion and ban all russian and belarus athletes from participating in the most popular swim race in the world, as they support putin's regime and the war.Sport has always been separated from politics. But sport has also been the synonym of peace. The great tradition to stop wars during the Olympics have been broken 3 times during World War I and II. And today the world stands at the doors of World War III. Today, being silent means to support the war. Today, there is no other position than be strict in your peaceful values, as the whole worlds does.Don't be silent! Stop Russian Aggression! Stop the War!"

This gene facilitates in effective functioning of the neuromuscular system. When Zolegensma is injected a copy of SMN1 gene is delivered which helps to encode SMN protein. The SMN protein activates the nerves to give signal to muscles to work properly. The efficiency rate is remarkable in the 1000+ babies who received Zolgensma.

We hereby request Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Central Finance Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman to exempt tax and import duties for Baby Mithra's treatment.

We request everyone to sign up this campaign and show your support to Baby Mithra and request our Honorable Prime Minister to waive off Rs 6 crore tax on Zolgensma, imported Medicine."

European Union and United Nations calls for a global shift to a vegan diet to survive hunger, poverty and climate change- Unión Europea y Naciones Unidas hacen llamamiento a un cambio global hacia una dieta vegana para sobrevivir a la hambruna, a la pobreza y al cambio climático



The objective is to promote, once again, the idea that the production and consumption of the body of the animals should be abolished. The demand for abolition of meat is the logical consequence of vegetarianism or veganism. People who are against the bull, for example., Do not just ask the public to boycott bullfights: demand that they be prohibited. Campaigners against foie gras do not just ask people not to buy it: they want the forced feeding of geese is prohibited. Because those who are opposed to the flesh are the only individual to be confined to giving advice? From the point of view of movement, refusing to eat meat can be regarded as a political boycott, as an expression of individual support abolition. In Britain, the late 18 th century, during the movement for the abolition of slavery, 300 thousand people boycotted sugar produced by slaves on plantations. The movement for the abolition of meat expresses a political approach: its purpose is to bring the public to subscribe to the idea that meat should be banned. The goal is that human societies, one after the other, they decide to ban the production, sale and consumption of meat. The idea is to claim loud and clear that not only has the responsibility of each individual to stop supporting the murderous exploitation requested by the consumption of animal bodies and ""animal derivatives"", but that is also, therefore, a duty of any society as a whole to declare In favor of the ban on the rearing, fishing and hunting.

10 Moltiplicando il consumo pro capite di diversi alimenti in USA (colonna A) per i pounds di grano e soia necessari per la produzione di un pound di ciascuno di essi (colonna B) possiamo determinare il numero di pound di grano e soia necessari a produrre manzo, pollo e latticini consumati mediamente da un americano nell'arco di un anno (colonna C):



I II III

Manzo 73 16 1168

Maiale 59 6 354

Tacchino 15 4 60

Pollo 63 3 189

Uova 34 3 102

Latticini 603 1 603

1 pound al giorno di grano o una combinazione di grano e soia nutrono adeguatamente una persona per un anno. Dividendo la somma del grano e della soia consumati mediamente in un anno da un americano che si alimenta con carne e formaggi (2568 pound), per il grano e la soia necessari a nutrire un individuo per un anno (365 pound) scopriamo che 7 persone potrebbero nutrirsi con l'equivalente di quello che mangia un americano carnivoro (2568 / 365 = 7.04).



Questo scenario si basa sulla stima che il peso del bestiame viene determinato dalla quantita' di grano e soia consumata . Una porzione di carne e formaggio viene prodotta alimentando gli animali anche con il foraggio dei pascoli, ma nonostante cio', tra il 1979 e il 1988 ogni animale e' stato nutrito mediamente con 4680 pound di grano e soia (Ag. Stats. 1989; tables 74 and 75). Mentre a qualche livello la produzione di carne e latticini puo' risultare sostenibile alimentando gli animali col pascolo, la recente abitudine di utilizzare a questo scopo grandi quantita' di grano e soia provoca danni insostenibili all'ambiente.

473,Alessandro Barbero x Joe Rogan: Barbero ospite a JRE sul Comunismo e Berlinguer,"a critical stage, the climate has almost reached its point of no return, inequality between the",['Petizione diretta a Joe Rogan'],Alex C,Italia,42,Data di lancio 15 feb 2021,https://assets.change.org/photos/0/oh/qd/qaOhQDSsXNwZeFt-800x450-noPad.jpg?1613352416,"There's a bug in American culture and in all the cultures that are shaped by the American viewpoint, the bug is viewing Communism only as a bad thing.After the Cold War and the horrors of the Soviet and Chinese regimes, in the United States of America the idea that Communism is ineherently bad is popular and widespread.Americans, and most of Western societies, lack the understanding of the beliefs and ideals that Communism promoted in Europe during the 20th century, they lack the knowledge of the importance that Communism played in the Resistance against Fascism and Nazism during World War II, and they lack the awareness of how, in post-war Western Europe, the local communist movements acted as catalyst for social change, workers' rights, opposition to organized crime and overall equality in the texture of societies.Americans don't know about Enrico Berlinguer.

Right now the world is at a critical stage, the climate has almost reached its point of no return, inequality between the social classes is at an all-time high and capitalism is crumbling.The politics and policies that are implemented in the United States shape the policies and politics of the planet.The winds of change are surely blowing in the New Continent, people are toying with new ideas and the streets are filled with people.The American people are starting to understand the need for welfare, for universal health care and for free education for all.There's one big obstacle tough; the belief that socialist and communist policies and ideas are bad and are not worth considering.An idea, which is good in itself, can easily be discredited just by being labeled as ""socialist"" or ""communist"".A politician like Bernie Sanders, a moderate leftist by European standards, has had to defend himself for being called a Socialist, as if it's a bad thing in itself.This cultural bug shifts the conversation from the actual issues to a merely pseudo-political debate that doesn't help the people of the United States and the people of the world.

This is why we politely ask the help of Joe Rogan.His podcast, ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" is one the most followed cultural shows on the planet, it hosts, and is followed by, big personalities from all walks of life, personalities that actually are players of world politics and that can shape the political conversation of the United States, and hence the world.

This is why we politely ask Joe Rogan to host in his podcast Italian Professor and Historian Alessandro Barberohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_BarberoAlessandro Barbero is one of the most prominent cultural figures in Italy, a revered historian and opinion maker, that has slowly become a simbol for the New Italian Left.Professor Barbero has an history of Leftist ideals and used to be part of the extinct Italian Communist Party, and is an expert in the history of Communism, both in Italy and in Russia.

We think that Professor Barbero, given a platform like the Joe Rogan Experience, could explain to the American people the realities of Communism and the European Communist movements, helping in removing the stigma against Communism that slithers in the United States, facilitating the spread of ideas and social policies to the general public that are strongly needed right now to make the world a better place and save the planet.

Joe, give Barbero a chance!

E' presente un bug nella cultura Americana ed in tutte le culture che sono state fortemente plasmate dalla prospettiva Americana, il bug è vedere il Comunismo solo come una cosa negativa.Dopo la Guerra Fredda e gli orrori del regime Sovietico e del regime Cinese, negli Stati Uniti l'idea che il Comunismo sia intrisecamente cattivo è un'idea popolare e diffusa.Gli Americani, come la maggior parte delle società occidentali, non possiedono la conoscenza degli ideali che il Comunismo ha promosso in Europa durante il ventesimo secolo, non conoscono l'importanza che il Comunismo ha avuto nella Resistenza al fascismo ed al nazismo durante la Seconda Guerra Mondiale, non sanno di come, nell'Europa occidentale del dopoguerra, i movimenti comunisti locali sono stati catalizzatori per il cambiamento sociale, per i diritti dei lavoratori, per l'opposizione alla criminalità organizzata e per la lotta per l'uguaglianza fra le classi sociali.Gli Americani non sanno chi sia Enrico Berlinguer.In questo momento il mondo è in una condizione critica, il cambiamento climatico ha quasi raggiunto il punto di non ritorno, la disuguglianza fra le classi sociali è più alta che mai ed il capitalismo sta crollando su sè stesso.Le scelte politiche degli Stati Uniti plasmano la politica del pianeta.I venti del cambiamento stanno finalmente soffiando sul nuovo continente, le persone stanno intrattenendo nuove idee, ed il popolo riempie di nuovo le strade e le piazze.Il popolo Americano sta iniziando a capire l'importanza ed il bisogno del welfare, di un sistema sanitario universale e dell'istruzione gratuita per tutta la popolazione.Resta però un grande ostacolo in questa lotta, la credenza che le politiche Socialiste e Comuniste siano sbagliate e che non valga la pena nemmeno di considerarle.Negli Stati Uniti un'idea giusta può essere facilmente screditata semplicemente etichettandola come ""socialista"" o ""comunista"".

Un politico come Bernie Sanders, considerato un moderato di sinistra per gli standard Europei, ha dovuto difendersi dalle accuse di Socialismo, come se fosse una cosa negativa di per sè.Questo bug culturale sposta la conversazione dai problemi effettivi ad un dibattito pseudo-politico che non aiuta gli Stati Uniti, e non aiuta il mondo.Per questi motivi chiediamo gentilmente l'aiuto di Joe Rogan.Il suo podcast, ""Joe Rogan Experience"", è uno dei programmi culturali più seguiti del pianeta; il podcast ospita, ed è seguito da, alcune delle personalità più importanti dei nostri giorni, persone che hanno una voce nella politica mondiale e che possono influenzare la conversazione politica negli Stati Uniti, e quindi nel mondo.Chiediamo quindi, gentilmente, a Joe Rogan di intervistare nel suo podcast il Professore e Storico Alessandro Barbero.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_BarberoAlessandro Barbero è una delle figure culturali più importanti d'Italia, uno storico ed opinionista rispettato, che è lentamente diventato il simbolo della Nuova Sinistra.Il Professor Barbero ha una storia di ideali di Sinistra ed era un membro del compianto PCI, ed è un esperto nella storia del Comunismo, sia in Italia che in Russia.Noi pensiamo che il Professor Barbero, grazie ad una piattaforma come la Joe Rogan Experience, possa spiegare al popolo Americano le realtà del Comunismo e del Comunismo Europeo, iniziando un processo di rivalutazione del Comunismo, aiutando a rimuovere lo stigma negativo che circonda l'idea di Comunismo negli Stati Uniti, facilitando la diffusione di idee e politiche sociali che sono fortemente necessarie per rendere il mondo un posto migliore.Joe, dai una chance a Barbero!- I sognatori della Sinistra -"

Parents are kept awake at night worrying about the long-term future of their children with disabilities, and they struggle every day to get proper supports for them.  Meanwhile, their concerns are often shrugged off when their children are placed inappropriately -- in segregated classes or schools, in workshops paying pennies a day, and even in seniors' homes.  For example, lively 49-year-old Teresa Pocock (pictured above) was rescued from a long-term care facility that specialized in dementia and palliative care patients.  Teresa is just one of thousands, and most don't get out! (See her petition: www.change.org/teresapocock, which was recently closed when she received a personal letter of apology from Dr. Eric Hoskins, Ontario's Minister of Health.)

In her June 22 announcement on consultation for new disability legislation, the Minister of Sport and Disabilities, Carla Qualtrough, acknowledged just how defenceless people with disabilities are:  “Right now, within our current legal framework, the rights of those of us with disabilities don’t kick in ... until our rights have been violated. The current system unfairly burdens Canadians to ever defend our rights.”

Obviously, persons with disabilities should not have to defend their rights in court, yet at present violations under the CRPD cannot even be reported to the UN because Canada has not signed the Protocol.  If it truly wants to protect disability rights, therefore, our current government will need to attend to this unfinished business of the previous government.

In signing the CRPD, the Canadian government promised to uphold the rights of persons with disabilities.  If it enforces its own disability laws the Protocol will not be necessary -- otherwise Canadians will need it as a final resort.

Over 26,000 Canadians are looking forward to having Prime Minister Trudeau safeguard disability rights by signing and ratifying the Protocol by the end of 2017.



Please sign this petition and urge Prime Minister Trudeau to add this task to his priority list.

As India is debating the recent legislation Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, we have witnessed a number of peaceful protests by different sections of people including students, lawyers, civil rights activists across the nation. Allowing peaceful protests and engaging with the dissenters is a true essence of a vibrant democracy and Internet has played an indispensable role in providing the common Indian with a platform to raise her/ his voice. However, the recent turn of events has been quite unfortunate and threatens the very core of Indian Constitutionalism. Instead of furthering the cause of empowering people’s voice and addressing their concerns, the authorities across the country have come down heavily on cutting down people’s access to the Internet. With over 366 shutdowns, India has emerged as the world’s capital of  Internet Shutdowns. Initially these shutdowns were localized to different states, particularly the State of Jammu and Kashmir (136 days and counting) and such a shutdown in the New Delhi (national capital region) was a distant reality. However, today i.e. December 19, 2019 would go as one of the darkest days in the Indian history where the authorities in order to curb the dissenting voices cut their Internet access in the NATIONAL CAPITAL of the world’s largest DEMOCRACY.

Such orders, even if allowed under the existing laws, should be rarely issued in circumstances where there is ABSOLUTELY no alternative available to address a grave and imminent threat to violence. Resorting to decades’ old provisions under the Code of Criminal Procedure (S. 144) to attack people’s right to communicate is a direct attack on our Right to Information and Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression.

Our Government encourages people and technology companies to join the cause of “Digital India” initiative, however, such arbitrary and indiscriminate use of police power will cause an irreversible damage to India’s reputation as a “vibrant” democracy and an aspiring Digital hub. The Internet is inextricable to all aspects of people’s daily lives, ranging from conducting business, calling for medical emergencies to ensuring the safety and security of one’s close individuals. Lack of Internet not only adversely impacts the economy but also leads to hysteria. We’ve never heard of Internetshutdowns in democracies like the United States despite the strong criticisms against the President or in the United Kingdom with the agitations related to Brexit or in New Zealand when the Christchurch attack happened, but only in countries like Pakistan, Iraq, Syria and Iran. It calls for our attention to deliberate as to which group we’d like our “democratic” nation to be associated with.

WE, CITIZENS OF THE WORLD, categorically condemn these actions of the different state governments and the central government in India as direct attacks on fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution. By signing this petition, we call upon the public representatives to ensure that Internetshutdowns are not frequently ordered in India and adequate reforms are undertaken to the existing laws.

As the world keenly observes the ongoing developments in India, it is extremely important that the Indian Government respects the Indian Constitution. It is only by respecting the supremacy of the Indian Constitution and ensuring that the last dissenting voice does not go unheard, we will be able to do justice to the “Tryst with Destiny” promised to awakening India at the stroke of midnight hour on August 15, 1947.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

481,Give Autistic children the education they deserve. Revamp the ASD school system in Ireland,"to gear up to him starting primary school next September, beginning his many years of education account.
 I challenge the Minister for Education Joe McHugh and the Irish goverbent to make a stand and to improve education in Ireland for autistic children. Get our children the school places they deserve. Give them the education they deserve.Show me that you think our children are just as important",['Irish Government'],Nicole Duggan,Ireland,59821,"Oct 18, 2018",https://assets.change.org/photos/2/aj/ir/VtajIrRUUVutYjw-800x450-noPad.jpg?1539886041,"

My name is Nicole Duggan, and I am a mom to an amazing little boy named Riley. Riley is almost 5 years old and is an amazing little boy. With the age that he is you would think we would be starting to gear up to him starting primary school next September, beginning his many years of education. You would think we would be attending open nights, trying to decide where he will attend. Where I will pick for him to start school. You would think I would have a plan in place for my son having put his name down for school at 3 months old.

You would think these things.

But you see when my son was 2 years and 9 months he was diagnosed with Autism. Riley is non-verbal. He has a lot of sensory issues. He suffers with anxiety and at almost 5 years old he is still not toilet trained.

Due to a diagnosis this country is letting my child and every other autistic child down. Riley cannot attend a mainstream school, due to his needs. He needs more specialised care. Riley needs a placement within an ASD specific unit, as stated by a multi disciplinary team in our health system, the HSE. Fair enough, you would think.

As of June 2019, my son does not have a school place. Although his name has been put down for units all over Cork, no places are available. I have been in contact with 37 units in our county, who have ASD units. Out of those 37 Units, there is not one place available for next year.

This is the case for so many children all over the country. As parents, we do not get to pick where our children go to school, we are expected to be happy if they get a place. We do not get to have the excitement of our children starting primary school, because we don't know if they will actually get a place. We spend our days ringing schools, ringing SENO's, ringing TD's and hoping that someone will have a positive answer for us. Those positive answers are rare.

The department of education's answer? Home tuition. An answer I will not be accepting.My son will NOT be home tutored.

This country thinks it is acceptable to remove our kids from a school setting and have them schooled at home, due to ""lack of resources"". Our children who thrive on routine, are forced to be moved from pillar to post and are not a priority to our government.The Irish Government think it is acceptable to deprive our children of the social aspect of school, something they so very much need. They think it is acceptable to deprive our children of being in a school setting, making friends, and finding their own bit of independence, by having them home schooled, this is not acceptable.

As a parent, it is heart breaking to think that our children are bottom of the pile. The government cannot tell a neurotypical child that they do not have a school place for them. Why is my child any different?

Autism makes them different, not less. My child, and all other autistic children, have a right to an education.They have a right to go to school. They have a right to be included.

1 in 65 children in Ireland has a diagnosis of autism.This is not a small number.

Something needs to change!

The schooling system in place for autistic children, both in Primary and Secondary level, needs to be overhauled.More special needs schools need to be opened. More ASD specific units need to be opened. All teachers, mainstream or special needs, need specific Autism training. SNA's need to be made available for children who can cope in a mainstream class.Our children have a right to the support in the classroom and it is about time the Irish Governement started putting these supports in place.It is about time parents do not need to fight so hard to get what our children are entitled to.

Funding is not an excuse.Lack of resources is not an excuse.A lack of knowledge is not an excuse.

Autistic children are as much of a priority as any other child in this country.It is time for the Irish Government to take this into account.

I challenge the Minister for Education Joe McHugh and the Irish goverbent to make a stand and to improve education in Ireland for autistic children. Get our children the school places they deserve. Give them the education they deserve.Show me that you think our children are just as important as any other child.

I for one will not back down until this is done, and I know I have an army of parents behind me who are ready to fight.

Please sign to show your support to change this system for our children



Thank you

482,"Implement a Black, Indigenous & Minority Application Program at OVC","Indigenous communities, which continues to have impacts today on both their people and their animals. These to that of the University of Toronto which includes Black, Indigenous and other minority groups",['Dr. Joanne Hewson'],Mahsa Nasseri,"Cats, Canada",3537,"Jun 4, 2020",https://assets.change.org/photos/9/rf/hb/TArfHbQXzIoqxOx-800x450-noPad.jpg?1591290123,"In light of the current world issues surrounding the Black Lives Matter Movement, my classmates and I were discussing ways in which we could participate in implementing change. It felt empowering seeing that OVC is also passionate regarding progressing towards an anti-racist environment as expressed on its social media pages.

Anecdotally, it seems that OVC’s student body is lacking in ethnic diversity and is primarily white dominated. We feel that representation of minority groups in veterinary medicine is extremely important as it champions the improvement of animal welfare within these tight-knit communities. We also recognize there may be more barriers towards getting into OVC for minority groups, for example lack of veterinarian role models in minority groups, cultural differences in the view of animals/pets, and access to financial resources to build a hardy supplementary application.

Recently, we discovered that the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine has started the “Black Student Application Program”, which is an “optional application stream for Black applicants who self-identify as Black African, Black Caribbean, Black North American, multi-racial students who have and identify with their Black ancestry, etc.” The program has been widely successful. While looking at the statistics from their Class of 2020, there was only one black graduate. The first year for which the program was implemented (Class of 2022), there was a jump to 14 black students, and then again for the Class of 2024, 24 black students! The University of Toronto Law school has also started a similar, successful program.

Systemic discrimination towards all minority groups is a problem in Canada. Specifically we have a horrific history of generational systemic racism towards the Indigenous communities, which continues to have impacts today on both their people and their animals. These communities often do not have access to veterinary care, and they don’t see themselves represented in the veterinary community. For this reason, we believe that OVC should implement a similar program to that of the University of Toronto which includes Black, Indigenous and other minority groups. This program could help to break down barriers faced by minority groups and foster a culturally inclusive environment at OVC. While we understand that it is too late for the 2024 class, we would like to plant the seeds of potential change for the Class of 2025.

As the #1 veterinary school in Canada known for its research and innovation, we believe that if there is any school to bring about powerful cultural change in the veterinary community, it is OVC. We believe that by setting this precedent, other veterinary schools in Canada would follow suit and develop similar student programs."

To do both, the Northwest needs the lower Snake River dams.

Here are some facts that we ask you to consider:

PREVENTING BLACKOUTS

Most regional energy forecasters, including the Northwest Power & Conservation Council, the Northwest Power Pool, E3, and Energy Strategies are warning of the real threat of an energy shortage or region-wide blackouts for the Northwest as the region moves away from coal and natural gas generation.

The risk would be much worse without the lower Snake River dams in place, which typically produce enough carbon-free electricity to power a city the size of Seattle.

PREVENTING AN ECONOMIC CRISIS

An energy shortage can result in problems that go beyond blackouts. During the last energy shortage in 2000-2001, the Northwest didn't experience blackouts, but still lost 5,000 living-wage jobs as electricity bills skyrocketed.

Imagine what a repeat would mean now, at a time when the region has a homelessness crisis and an affordable housing shortage.

The dams also provide the only source of irrigation for tens of thousands of acres in eastern Washington. Those farms, in turn, provide many diverse and under-served communities with agricultural work.

Many agricultural communities across the inland Northwest also depend on the dams to provide access for low-carbon barging to get their produce to market.

CLEAN ENERGY GOALS

The lower Snake River dams are essential to reaching the Northwest’s clean energy goals. They generate over 1,000 average megawatts of affordable, carbon-free electricity. They also help us safely add intermittent renewables, like wind and solar power, to the grid.

The hydroelectric turbines at the dams can very quickly fill in the gaps for wind and sunshine, keeping the grid balanced.

ORCAS

We believe that the many billions of dollars it would take to breach the dams and replace their capabilities would be much more effectively spent on cleaning up the Puget Sound, where the Southern Resident orcas spend most of their lives.

It is well documented that the Puget Sound suffers from high levels of toxicity which affect both Pacific Salmon and orcas. Salmon in the Puget Sound have been found with measurable levels of antidepressants, nicotine, herbicides, and even cocaine in their systems. Because orcas eat large amounts of salmon, these toxins become concentrated in their fat. These substances may be passed along to orca calves through their mothers’ milk.

It will take massive investments and the whole region pulling together to repair the Puget Sound and its tributaries so that the area is suitable for healthy salmon and orca populations.

ENDANGERED SALMON & STEELHEAD

Salmon and steelhead are critically important to the region. They have an especially deep meaning to the spiritual, cultural, and economic lives for Northwest Native American tribes.

We believe that important steps can and must be taken to improve salmon survival.

It is also important to recognize the major fish passage improvements made to the lower Snake River dams. Over $2 billion has been invested in improved fish passage technologies for the lower Snake and lower Columbia river dams since 2001.

These improvements have made a significant difference in juvenile salmon survival. Additionally, from 2001-2015 the lower Snake River experienced by far its highest adult salmon returns since the first lower Snake River dam was completed in 1961.

OUR OCEANS NEED HEALING

Salmon pass through many different ecosystems in their life cycles. The ocean is where Chinook salmon spend 75% of their lives.

In 2019, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that climate-driven changes have become a major threat to marine life in ocean ecosystems. They said that these changes are poisoning our oceans with carbon, heat, and acidity and depleting the waters of oxygen.

It’s not surprising, then, that marine biologists have recently noted near-synchronous declines in worldwide salmon populations. Most of these salmon populations come from rivers without dams.

Meanwhile, the lower Snake River dams can displace as much carbon as would be produced by two Boardman coal plants running 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

CONCLUSION

When you look at the issue in this larger context, it’s clear that destroying the lower Snake River dams is a step in the wrong direction. It is wrong for vulnerable communities and for the long-term health of our planet.

We urge you to support a clean and equitable energy future because we are stronger when we join together.

This event of hatred, and countless events prior directed at the Asian American community, have left us devastated.

It is during this time that we, the Asian student body at the University of Central Florida, call upon our fellow peers, faculty, staff, administrators, President, and Board of Trustees to action.

We have read countless emails directed at fostering unity. We have held countless discussions so that our plea for equity and justice can be heard. We are TIRED of inaction and the lack of accountability from our administrators. We will no longer accept complacency.

Now, is the time to demand our institutions to acknowledge these crimes by putting forth action: to direct justice-oriented policy, structure, and strategies that not only addresses racial injustice, but actively fights for racial justice.

We call upon the administrators at UCF to establish student-operated agencies for Black Affairs, Latinx Affairs, Pride Affairs, and APIDA Affairs under the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) and founding Office of the Vice President for Equity and Inclusion. These agencies must be equipped with full time staff that drive forward change through innovative initiatives centered around anti-racism, mentorship programs between alumni, staff, and students, funding allocations for cultural groups, and collaboration with existing multicultural departments/student organizations.

No child, and especially no child on American soil, should ever be put in a position in which they are scared, hungry, sick, cold, feel unsafe, or experience life-altering trauma. Yet many of us across the political spectrum have watched with increasing horror as conditions continue to deteriorate at our border for children of all ages seeking refuge and asylum in the United States.

In the words of former First Lady Laura Bush: “Americans pride ourselves on being a moral nation, on being the nation that sends humanitarian relief to places devastated by natural disasters or famine or war.” There is a public health emergency unfolding at our own border, impacting hundreds of children, and our nation’s leaders must respond swiftly and effectively.

Congress has passed a humanitarian aid bill, but it will take time to organize and implement the funds to make a difference in the lives of these children. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security must work together in the short-term to resolve the immediate crisis.

As our political leaders work towards a sustainable immigration solution, we must not lose sight of who we are as Americans. No child in crisis should have to wait to have their basic health and safety needs met."

However spying on students through monitoring their social media, their personal chats, and their video calls is not the way to do that. Lightspeed and GoGaurdian are gross violations of privacy. Students should be allowed to have their personal privacies not be invaded by their schools.

Students and their parents should be able to reject these privacy invasions if they so choose. No student and their families should be force to undergo close monitoring when they have done nothing wrong. Many students can multitask and do two things at once and assuming, in many cases legal adults, need spying in order to achieve productivity is negligent at best, and dangerous at worst.

This is a strong overreach, and we should not allow private companies to collect students intimate data. These private companies are not subject to the public opinion and allowing unelected officials, or anyone, to collect minors messages to each other, and collect minors video calls to each other is terrible.

You must oppose this policy, and allow students to have their freedoms from monitoring very personal data. No students who have done nothing wrong should have their freedoms incredibly restricted. How can students feel comfortable when they know a private company can ""work across search engines, chat, social media, email, web apps, and more"" and with ""beacon quietly analyz(zing) online activity"" how can a student feel satisfied with their education. This spying is horrible for student mental health.

Kids over 13, as described in the recent COPPA notice, should be able to opt out of this program. They should be able to avoid spying from private companies. Emailing Princeton school officials and attending school board meetings against this policy will end this overreach.

488,Petition the International Maritime Organization to Stop Plastic Pellet Pollution at Sea,public support in advance of this meeting will be enormously helpful towards securing such measures,['International Maritime Organization (IMO)'],Environmental Investigation Agency,"London, ENG, United Kingdom",89876,10 Nov 2021,https://assets.change.org/photos/4/cf/gq/EsCFGQjZsUnVfss-800x450-noPad.jpg?1637073166,"In May 2021, the MV X-Press Pearl spilt 1,680 tonnes of plastic pellets and 9,700 tonnes of other plastics nine miles off the Sri Lankan coast. With plastic accumulating on beaches up to 2 meters high, it is one of the worst environmental disasters in the country's history, and the single largest plastic pellet pollution event the world has ever seen. It continues to cause overwhelming economic, social and environmental impacts, and a legacy of toxic pollution that will continue to have profound and enduring impacts for many generations to come.

This incident has resulted in the severe pollution of 750 km of pristine, biodiverse coastline and deaths of many hundreds of charismatic marine species such as turtles, whales and dolphins. Consumption of fish, which is the main protein source for more than 40% of Sri Lankans, has reduced drastically, and the livelihood of fishers is severely impacted due to coastal fishing ban across the entire West coast.

Plastic pellets (also known as 'nurdles') are tiny lentil-sized balls measuring 5mm or less. They are the feedstock of the industry - and are melted and moulded by manufacturing companies into plastic products. Given their small size, they are easily and often spilt at each stage along the pellet supply chain, and increasingly large scale spillage events are occurring at sea.

However, despite being found on almost every coastline surveyed, and with growing evidence that pellets act as toxic sponges and are eaten by a wide range of marine life, they are currently not considered to be persistent, hazardous, pollutants. Stricter classification under the International Maritime Organization would mean pellets are handled at sea akin to other harmful and hazardous substances. This classification would mean far stricter handling and labelling instructions are enforced, below deck stowage and adequate disaster response protocols that would limit the fallout felt in Sri Lanka in the wake of future shipping disasters.

From November 22nd - November 25th, the International Maritime Organization's Marine Environment Protection Committee will meet. On the agenda is a proposal from Sri Lanka to establish international guidelines and requirements for the transportation of plastic pellets that are so urgently needed.

A show of public support in advance of this meeting will be enormously helpful towards securing such measures, and raising the profile of this little-known but highly destructive form of plastic pollution."

491,I stand with Afghan Women: #AllOrNone,,,Farida Razaqi,"Herat, Afghanistan",39976,30 Dec 2022,https://assets.change.org/photos/5/po/wf/NuPoWfBrXxTeVpj-800x450-noPad.jpg?1672359875,"In early 2019, the United States officially resumed its direct negotiations with the Taliban to reach an agreement on a joint framework for a future peace agreement in Afghanistan. As a result, the Taliban were given standing and leverage, which they used to extract major concessions, including the withdrawal of the international military forces from Afghanistan and the release of 5,000 high-profile members of the Taliban from Afghanistan’s prisons. However, on August 15, 2021, the Taliban illegally took over Afghanistan by force. Despite initially promising a more moderate rule respecting rights for women and minorities, the Taliban have widely and strictly implemented their restrictive interpretation of Sharia law since they seized power in Afghanistan. The Taliban’s actions have included banning girls from attending secondary schools; depriving women of participating in almost all spheres of society and public life, including restaurants, parks, and gyms; and imposing hijab rules and gender segregation in the few institutions that were supposed to provide educational and employment opportunities for women. On top of these, in another inhumane action, following a decree dated December 20, 2022, the Taliban officially banned women from universities and deprived them of their right to employment at all levels, effective immediately. As a result, Afghan women and girls have been forced to bear complete isolation and denial of their most basic rights.

The Taliban’s actions against women contravene national law, jus cogens norms of international law, human rights, Islamic doctrine, and shared human values, which no regime can derogate from under any circumstances. Equally, the Taliban’s actions are against the culture and beliefs of the people in Afghanistan. The Taliban have, unfortunately, made Afghanistan the only country in the world where women are deprived of their most basic and fundamental rights and are removed from society.

Since the beginning of peace negotiations with the Taliban, Afghan women were never optimistic towards a joint future with the Taliban in terms of preserving their rights, since they believed the current Taliban held the same extremist ideology against women as the previous incarnation of the Taliban in the 1990s. Thus, many feared that any reintegration of the Taliban into society would mean a repetition of past horrors or an invitation to even darker days. Women bravely raised their concerns against any peace deal with the Taliban on many occasions. However, what is deplorable is that these voices were never heard: not in the U.S.-led negotiations with the Taliban, nor in the intra-Afghan peace talks, nor by the regional and international actors involved in the process.

The Taliban’s bans on education and employment of women serves to establish gender apartheid and to enact a policy of animosity, discrimination, and oppression against women in Afghanistan. The destructive impacts of this policy are not only limited to women’s identity and situation; rather, the Taliban have undermined the development of the whole country and its people at large. These bans leave no doubt of the Taliban’s intention to impose and institutionalize their fundamentalist and extremist narratives on the lives of all Afghan people. Once again, the Taliban’s despicable policies against women have proven to be extremely threatening to all aspects of people’s lives, from the structures of the family to the social, economic, political, and legal foundations of Afghanistan. And the Taliban’s actions threaten regional and global peace and security.

For these reasons, the current Taliban de facto authorities have no recognition, place, or legality to the people of Afghanistan and should have no standing in the international community. Therefore, in order to find possible solutions for the current humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, a transnational discourse should be held, and an urgent and robust mechanism for restoring human rights in Afghanistan should be initiated. There is an urgent need for the advocates of humanity to move beyond mere condemnations of the Taliban’s brutality and to begin taking practical actions to uplift the voices of Afghan women.

We strongly believe that one of the main motives of the Taliban de facto authorities in moving to exclude Afghan women from society and taking their rights hostage is to gain international recognition. Under these circumstances any support or recognition of the Taliban de facto authorities by the regional and international powers, despite the Taliban’s clear violation of human rights and international norms, is a historical shame that will be followed by international responsibility and accountability to all involved.

Therefore, global condemnation of and efforts to stop the brutal actions of the Taliban should include the following:

We urge academic institutions, human rights organizations and defenders, and women’s rights advocates not to leave Afghan women alone in this crisis and their resistance. Afghan women are being killed, arrested, and tortured just for asking for their fundamental rights and for standing against the inhumane actions of the Taliban since the collapse of the former Afghan government. As human beings, we all have the shared responsibility to support and stand with those in need. Therefore, in this challenging situation, there is an urgent need to stand together, raise our voices, and take action against brutal human rights violations in Afghanistan.
