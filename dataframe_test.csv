АЛЕКСАНДР САБУРОВ МЫ ОБРАЩАЕМСЯ К ВАМ С ПРОСЬБОЙ ЗАЩИТИТЬ ТЫСЯЧИ ЗАМУЧЕННЫХ ЖИВОТНЫХ КАЗАХСТАНА , ГДЕ ЕЖЕДНЕВНО ОТЛОВЫ СЖИГАЮТ В ПЕЧАХ СОТНИ СОБАК И КОШЕК . ЗАЧАСТУЮ ЕЩЁ ЖИВЫХ . В КАЗАХСТАНЕ XXI ВЕКА ВАРВАРСКОЕ ОТНОШЕНИЕ К ЖИВОТНЫМ - ЭТО НОРМА . ЗАКОНА ОБ ИХ ЗАЩИТЕ НЕТ . ДЛЯ МНОГИХ ЖИТЕЛЕЙ КАЗАХСТАНА ЖИВОТНОЕ - ЭТО МУСОР , СОРНЯК И ЖИЗНЬ ЕГО НИЧЕГО НЕ СТОИТ . ЛЮБОЙ ЖИТЕЛЬ СТРАНЫ МОЖЕТ ПОЗВОНИТЬ В ОТЛОВ И СООБЩИТЬ О БЕЗДОМНОМ ЖИВОТНОМ , ЗАРАНЕЕ ОБРЕКАЯ ЕГО НА НЕИЗБЕЖНУЮ ГИБЕЛЬ . КРАТКО О СИТУАЦИИ В КАЗАХСТАНЕ . 1 . В КАЗАХСТАНЕ НЕ РАБОТАЕТ ЗАКОН О ЗАЩИТЕ ПРАВ ЖИВОТНЫХ . 2 . В КАЗАХСТАНЕ НЕ РАБОТАЮТ ПРОГРАММЫ СТЕРИЛИЗАЦИИ И ВАКЦИНАЦИИ . 3 . В КАЗАХСТАНЕ НЕТ ПРЕДСТАВИТЕЛЬСТВ МЕЖДУНАРОДНЫХ ОРГАНИЗАЦИЙ ПО ЗАЩИТЕ ЖИВОТНЫХ . 4 . В КАЗАХСТАНЕ НЕТ ЕДИНОГО ЗООЗАЩИТНОГО ДВИЖЕНИЯ . 5 . ВОЛОНТЕРСКИЕ ГРУППЫ В КАЗАХСТАНЕ СУЩЕСТВУЮТ , НО ИХ УСИЛИЯ ПО СПАСЕНИЮ ЖИВОТНЫХ СЛИШКОМ РАЗРОЗНЕННЫ И ХАОТИЧНЫ . МЕЖДУ ВОЛОНТЕРАМИ НЕТ СПЛОЧЁННОСТИ В БОРЬБЕ ЗА ОБЩЕЕ ДЕЛО , И ПОЭТОМУ , СПАСАЯ МНОГИХ ЖИВОТНЫХ , ОНИ НЕ МОГУТ ПОМОЧЬ ВСЕМ . 6 . ВОЛОНТЕРЫ ИЗ РАЗНЫХ СТРАН ПЫТАЮТСЯ ПОМОЧЬ ЖИВОТНЫМ КАЗАХСТАНА . ОНИ СПАСАЮТ СОБАК И КОШЕК ИЗ ОТЛОВОВ И ДОБИВАЮТСЯ ИЗМЕНЕНИЯ ЗАКОНОДАТЕЛЬСТВА СТРАНЫ . НО , НАХОДЯСЬ ЗА ТЫСЯЧИ КИЛОМЕТРОВ ОТ КАЗАХСТАНА , ВОЛОНТЕРАМ ТРУДНО ПОВЛИЯТЬ НА СИТУАЦИЮ ПО ТЕЛЕФОНУ И ЧЕРЕЗ ИНТЕРНЕТ . КАК ИТОГ , РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ ИХ ДЕЯТЕЛЬНОСТИ НЕЗНАЧИТЕЛЬНЫ . ФИНАНСОВЫЕ ВОЗМОЖНОСТИ ВОЛОНТЕРОВ ОГРАНИЧЕНЫ , И ПОЭТОМУ КОЛИЧЕСТВО ВЫВОЗИМЫХ ИЗ ОТЛОВОВ ЖИВОТНЫХ МИНИМАЛЬНО . 7 . УБИЙСТВО БЕЗДОМНЫХ ЖИВОТНЫХ В КАЗАХСТАНЕ ПРЕВРАТИЛОСЬ В МАСШТАБНЫЙ БИЗНЕС . ГОСУДАРСТВО ПЛАТИТ ОТЛОВАМ ЗА КАЖДОГО ПОЙМАННОГО И ЗАБИТОГО ИМИ ЗВЕРЯ . ПЕРЕДЕРЖКИ СОБАК , ВЕТЕРИНАРНЫЕ КЛИНИКИ , ЗООТАКСИ - ВСЕ НАЖИВАЮТСЯ НА ВОЛОНТЁРАХ , ВЫНУЖДЕННЫХ ПОЛЬЗОВАТЬСЯ ИХ УСЛУГАМИ ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ЖИВОТНЫХ . ЧТО ПРОИСХОДИТ НА УЛИЦАХ КАЗАХСТАНА ? СОТРУДНИКИ ОТЛОВОВ `` ВЫХОДЯТ НА ОХОТУ '' ЕЖЕДНЕВНО . ОНИ ХВАТАЮТ ВСЕХ , КТО ПОПАДЕТСЯ У НИХ НА ПУТИ : ВЗРОСЛЫХ ОСОБЕЙ , ЩЕНКОВ И КОТЯТ . РАБОТНИКИ ИЗОЛЯТОРОВ ВРЕМЕННОГО СОДЕРЖАНИЯ ( КАК ОНИ ОФИЦИАЛЬНО СЕБЯ НАЗЫВАЮТ ) ЗАБИРАЮТ И ДОМАШНИХ ЖИВОТНЫХ - В ОТЛОВАХ МНОГО СОБАК В ОШЕЙНИКАХ . ПОЙМАННЫМ ЖИВОТНЫМ ДАЕТСЯ В СРЕДНЕМ ТРИ ДНЯ , ЧТОБЫ ИМ УЛЫБНУЛАСЬ УДАЧА И ЗА НИМИ ПРИШЕЛ СПАСИТЕЛЬ ( ХОЗЯИН ИЛИ ВОЛОНТЁР ) . ДЛЯ ОСТАЛЬНЫХ ИСХОД ОДИН – МУЧИТЕЛЬНАЯ СМЕРТЬ . СОГЛАСНО ЗАКОНОДАТЕЛЬСТВУ КАЗАХСТАНА , ЖИВОТНЫЕ ДОЛЖНЫ СОДЕРЖАТЬСЯ В ОТЛОВАХ В ТЕЧЕНИЕ 60 СУТОК С ТЕМ , ЧТОБЫ НАШЕЛСЯ ИХ ВЛАДЕЛЕЦ . ЕСЛИ ХОЗЯИН НЕ НАЙДЕН , ТО ЗВЕРЬ ОФИЦИАЛЬНО ПРИОБРЕТАЕТ СТАТУС НИЧЕЙНОГО , И ТОГДА ОТЛОВ , КАК НОВЫЙ СОБСТВЕННИК , ПРИНИМАЕТ РЕШЕНИЕ О СУДЬБЕ УЗНИКА . НО В РЕАЛЬНОСТИ ВСЕ НЕ ТАК ! ЖИВОТНЫХ ОТСТРЕЛИВАЮТ ПРЯМО НА УЛИЦАХ ИЛИ ДОСТАВЛЯЮТ В ИЗОЛЯТОРЫ И УНИЧТОЖАЮТ В ТЕЧЕНИЕ 2-3 ДНЕЙ . 50 СОБАК И 100 ЩЕНКОВ ЗА ДЕНЬ В ОТЛОВЕ – ОБЫЧНОЕ ДЕЛО . УСЛОВИЯ СОДЕРЖАНИЯ В ТАКИХ КОНЦЛАГЕРЯХ АДСКИЕ . ЗАЧАСТУЮ ЖИВОТНЫХ НЕ КОРМЯТ И НЕ ДАЮТ ИМ ВОДЫ . СИДЯ НА БЕТОННОМ ПОЛУ КЛЕТОК , СОБАКИ ЗАМЕРЗАЮТ НАСМЕРТЬ . НА СВОИХ СТРАНИЦАХ В ИНСТАГРАМ ОТЛОВЫ ПУБЛИКУЮТ ФОТО СОБАК , КОШЕК , КОТЯТ И ЩЕНКОВ , ОЖИДАЮЩИХ СМЕРТЬ - ГЛАЗА ЖИВОТНЫХ НАПОЛНЕНЫ БОЛЬЮ И УЖАСОМ . КАК ЖИВОТНЫХ УБИВАЮТ ? ОТЛОВЫ ОЧЕНЬ ЖЕСТОКИ ПО ОТНОШЕНИЮ К ЖИВОТНЫМ . ПЕТЛИ , ИСПОЛЬЗУЕМЫЕ ДЛЯ ИХ ПОИМКИ , ЛОМАЮТ ШЕИ , ДУШАТ И ПЕРЕРЕЗАЮТ ИМ ГОРЛО . ОТСТРЕЛ СОБАК И КОШЕК ОТРАВЛЕННЫМИ ДРОТИКАМИ ИЛИ ПУЛЯМИ – ЭТО ВПОЛНЕ СТАНДАРТНАЯ СИТУАЦИЯ . В ОТЛОВАХ ДЛЯ УБИЙСТВ ИСПОЛЬЗУЕТСЯ МИОРЕЛАКСАНТ , ПОД ДЕЙСТВИЕМ КОТОРОГО ЖИВОТНОЕ ДОЛГО И МУЧИТЕЛЬНО ЗАДЫХАЕТСЯ - ЭТО В ЛУЧШЕМ СЛУЧАЕ . В ХУДШЕМ - КОШЕК И СОБАК КИДАЮТ В ПЕЧЬ ЕЩЁ ЖИВЫМИ . КАК МОЖНО ПРЕДСТАВИТЬ СЕБЕ ТАКУЮ ПЫТКУ В XXI ВЕКЕ ? ЛИЦА , СОВЕРШАЮЩИЕ ПОДОБНОЕ , В БОЛЬШИНСТВЕ СТРАН ЦИВИЛИЗОВАННОГО МИРА СЧИТАЮТСЯ ПСИХОПАТАМИ . А ЧТО ЖЕ ВЛАСТИ КАЗАХСТАНА ? ВЛАСТИ ОСТАЮТСЯ РАВНОДУШНЫМИ К СТРАДАНИЯМ ЖИВОТНЫХ , И ОНИ ЖЕСТОКИ В СВОЕМ БЕЗДЕЙСТВИИ . БРИДЖИТ БАРДО В 2019 ГОДУ В УЖАСЕ И ОТЧАЯНИИ ОБРАТИЛАСЬ К ПРЕЗИДЕНТУ КАЗАХСТАНА И , ССЫЛАЯСЬ НА ПРОДОЛЖАЮЩИЕ ПОСТУПАТЬ К НЕЙ ОТЗЫВЫ ПО ПОВОДУ ГИБЕЛИ СОБАК И КОШЕК В ЭТОЙ СТРАНЕ , ПРОСИЛА ГЛАВУ ГОСУДАРСТВА ОЗАБОТИТЬСЯ СУДЬБОЙ ЖИВОТНЫХ .

КАКОВЫ ПУТИ РЕШЕНИЯ ПРОБЛЕМЫ НЕГУМАННОГО ОТНОШЕНИЯ К ЖИВОТНЫМ В КАЗАХСТАНЕ ? 1 . ПРЕЗИДЕНТ И ПРАВИТЕЛЬСТВО КАЗАХСТАНА ДОЛЖНЫ ДОРАБОТАТЬ ЗАКОН О ЗАЩИТЕ ЖИВОТНЫХ И КОНТРОЛИРОВАТЬ ЕГО ИСПОЛНЕНИЕ . 2 . ПРЕЗИДЕНТ ДОЛЖЕН ПРЕКРАТИТЬ УНИЧТОЖЕНИЕ БРОДЯЧИХ ЖИВОТНЫХ . 3 .

بعمليات فساد كبيرة مما يودي الى حالة هيجان للمستخدمين في العراق حيث قامت الشركات مؤخراً بفصل خدمة الانترنيت لأيام عديدة وتقليل سرعة الاتصال الى اقل من 1 ميغابت يرجع السبب الى عدة تصريحات ف الشركات المجهزة للانترنيت في العراق ذكرت بان المشكلة حاصلة في قطع الكابل البحري وعند مناشدة وزارة الاتصالات يصرح المسوول الرسمي لها بان وزارة الاتصالات لا تعاني من اي مشاكل في بطئ الانترنيت والقطع الحاصل هو بسبب فساد الشركات المجهزة للانترنيت اي كيو نيتورك و سكوب سكاي ... ولا احد يستطيع محاسبتهم في العراق بسبب نفوذهم القوي في العراق من قبل باقي الشركات الداعمة لهم بسحب الخدمة وتوزيعها على المستخدمين مثل ايرثلنك و نوروز و الجزيرة وباقي الشركات التي تذم بعضها على سوء الخدمات والمستخدم هو الشخص الضعيف المتورط في هذه الشركات الطاغية التي لا نستطيع ايصال صوتنا اليهم بسبب الضغوطات من قبل الموظفين والنفوذ المسؤوليين , نحن نواجه هذه المشاكل لسنين وكل ما نطلبه هو خدمة انترنت جيدة مع اسعار معقولة لأننا نستحق ما ندفع لأجله . كما أعلنت الشركة الوطنية الممثلة بالشركة العامة للاتصالات ان إيراداتها من الانترنت يبلغ ( 150 ) مليون دولار سنويا مقابل حصولها على ( 10 لامدا ) فقط ، على الرغم من انها متعاقدة مع خمس شركات موردة للانترنت في العراق تصل سعاتها مجتمعة الى ( 90 لامدا ) أي ما يعادل ( 900 غيغابايت ) . مما يعني بأن هناك حوالي 80 لامدا تُهرب بدون تسجيل، وتستورد من دول الجوار بدون علم الحكومة العراقية، وتدفع اجورهن من قبل خمس شركات رئيسية وهي ( سكوب سكاي ‐ اي كيو – ونوروزتل ‐ ايرثلنك ‐ سرد ) . اذا ما افترضنا ان إيرادات الدولة ستكون 150 مليون دولار سنويا لقاء الـ ( 10 لامدا ) ، فهذا يعني ان ( 80 لامدا ) المهربة تؤتي إيرادات للدولة تصل الى 1.2 مليار دولار سنويا . أي يتم سرقة الدولة العراقية حوالي مليار وربع دولار سنويا من قبل هذه الشركات في ظل سكوت هيئة الاعلام والاتصالات وحماية واسناد ودعم وزارة الاتصالات . في تموز الماضي توجهت وزارة الاتصالات لتمييع هذه السرقة من خلال مشروع يحمل الاسم ( سمفوني ) وتحويل الكابلات من غير شرعية الى شرعية وتحويل الباندات ( الحزم ) للمشروع الجديد، واعطتها الشرعية تحت مسمى المشروع الوطني للانترنت، وهو تحايل وفساد واضح، اذ ستكون حصة الحكومة من هذا المليار وربع نحو 200 مليون فقط في احسن الأحوال . ولا يخفى ان مشروع مد الكابلات الضوئية هو مشروع متلكئ، ومُنح قسم منه لاصحاب الأبراج، الذين مدوا الكابلات بطريقة عشوائية وخارج الضوابط، وبعيدا عن التنسيق مع الدوائر الخدمية والبلدية . والان المستخدم العراقي يعاني من مشاكل كبيرة في الانترنيت بسبب الصراعات السياسية و التجارية بين الشركات وهذه دليل بسيط لقياس السرعات الحقيقية لكل الشركات المتورطة المصادر التي تقوم بتزويد العراق بالانترنت هي : 1- شركة اي كيو نيتورك | HTTPS : //BGP.HE.NET/AS442172- شركة سكوب سكاي | HTTPS : //BGP.HE.NET/AS50597 مطالبنة من خلال هذه الحملة هي بسيطة ومن حق اي مواطن : استرجاع جميع اموال المستخدمين الذين دفعوا مالهم ولم يستلموا كمقابل خدمة الانترنيت بصورة طبيعية .. او تعويضهم من خلال فترات مجانية مقابلة كتعويض بسيط من قبل الشركة المجهزةإصلاح المشاكل الحاصلة في شركات الانترنيت و إرجاع الخدمة الى صورتها الطبيعية عن طريق لجنة تحقيقية لمكافحة الفاسدين من اجل تطوير الخدمة وكشف التواطئ السياسي والجشع الحكومي في وزارة الأتصالات وهيئة الإعلام والأتصالات مع الشركات المجهزة والمصدرة لخدمة الأنترنيت.في حال لم تستطع الشركات الحالية اثبات كفائتها واستمرت في عملياته الملتوية لسرقة حقوق المستخدمين يتم دعوة الشركات العملاقة في الدول المجاورة لتقديم عروضها في معالجة الازمة الحاصلة في العراق مثل شركة TTNET التي تغطي خدماتها اكثر من 90 مليون مستخدم في دول المجاورةمن اكبر شركات تزويد الانترنيت في العراق هي شركة ايرثلنك للاتصالات وسيتم ذكر تفاصيل والمعانات الجارية

МИРОВАЯ ПРАКТИКА ПОКАЗЫВАЕТ , ЧТО РЕШИТЕЛЬНАЯ И ИНФОРМИРОВАННАЯ ОБЩЕСТВЕННОСТЬ ЯВЛЯЕТСЯ ДВИЖУЩЕЙ СИЛОЙ ПЕРЕМЕН ! СУЩЕСТВУЮЩИЕ СЕГОДНЯ СОВРЕМЕННЫЕ АЛЬТЕРНАТИВЫ , НЕ УСТУПАЮТ , А НАОБОРОТ ПРЕВОСХОДЯТ ПО ТОЧНОСТИ И ДОСТОВЕРНОСТИ УСТАРЕВШИЕ И ЖЕСТОКИЕ ВИВИСЕКЦИОННЫЕ ТЕСТЫ . УЧЁНЫЕ МОГУТ ВЫРАСТИТЬ В ЛАБОРАТОРИЯХ ЦЕЛЫЕ ОРГАНЫ ! НА ДВОРЕ XXI ВЕК , ТЕХНОЛОГИИ ШАГНУЛИ ОЧЕНЬ ДАЛЕКО . ЖИВОТНЫЕ , ИСПОЛЬЗУЕМЫЕ В ТЕСТИРОВАНИИ КОСМЕТИКИ , СТРАДАЮТ НАПРАСНО , ТАК КАК КОСМЕТИЧЕСКИЕ КОМПАНИИ В СОСТОЯНИИ СОЗДАВАТЬ КАЧЕСТВЕННЫЕ И БЕЗОПАСНЫЕ ПРОДУКТЫ , ИСПОЛЬЗУЯ ТЫСЯЧИ ДОСТУПНЫХ ИНГРЕДИЕНТОВ , КОТОРЫЕ ИМЕЮТ ИСТОРИЮ БЕЗОПАСНОГО ИСПОЛЬЗОВАНИЯ И НЕ ТРЕБУЮТ КАКИХ-ЛИБО НОВЫХ ИСПЫТАНИЙ . СОВРЕМЕННЫЕ МЕТОДЫ СОЧЕТАЮТ В СЕБЕ ТЕСТЫ НА КЛЕТКАХ ЧЕЛОВЕКА И СЛОЖНЫЕ КОМПЬЮТЕРНЫЕ МОДЕЛИ , ДАЮЩИЕ ТОЧНЫЕ РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ С МЕНЬШИМИ ЗАТРАТАМИ СРЕДСТВ И ВРЕМЕНИ , ЧЕМ ТЕСТЫ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ . БОЛЬНО И ДИКО ОСОЗНАВАТЬ , ЧТО ДО СИХ ПОР ПРОЩЕ ИЗДЕВАТЬСЯ НАД ТЕМИ , КТО НЕ МОЖЕТ СКАЗАТЬ СЛОВА ПРОТИВ , КТО ВООБЩЕ НЕ СПОСОБЕН ОТВЕТИТЬ . А ЧТО , ЕСЛИ БЫ ОНИ МОГЛИ ВЫРАЗИТЬ СВОЕ МНЕНИЕ ? НЕ ХОЧЕТСЯ ПОДНИМАТЬ ТЕМУ ГЕНОЦИДА И ПРОЧИХ ЧЕЛОВЕЧЕСКИХ КАТАСТРОФ , КОГДА ЛЮДЕЙ СТАВИЛИ НА ОДНУ СТУПЕНЬ С БЕЗМОЛВНЫМИ ЖИВОТНЫМИ И ОНИ ТОЧНО ТАК ЖЕ НЕ ИМЕЛИ ВОЗМОЖНОСТИ СКАЗАТЬ « НЕТ » ( А ЕСЛИ И ПРОБОВАЛИ , ТО ИСХОД БЫЛ ОЧЕВИДЕН ) . ВРЯД ЛИ НАШЛИ БЫ ПОЛОЖИТЕЛЬНЫЙ ОТКЛИК ОПЫТЫ С ТУШЬЮ , « ВЫЕДАЮЩЕЙ ГЛАЗА » ЧЕЛОВЕКУ ( ИЛИ , НАПРИМЕР , БЕЗЗАЩИТНОМУ РЕБЕНКУ ) , КОТОРЫЙ ПРИ ЭТОМ КРИЧИТ ОТ БОЛИ . МОЖЕТ , ВСЕ-ТАКИ , НАМ , КАК ВЫСШЕМУ ЗВЕНУ ЭВОЛЮЦИИ , ПОРА НАУЧИТЬСЯ ДУМАТЬ НЕ ТОЛЬКО О СЕБЕ И ПОЧАЩЕ ВСПОМИНАТЬ О ТОМ , ЧТО ЖИВОТНЫЕ , ТОЧНО ТАК ЖЕ , КАК ЛЮДИ , ЧУВСТВУЮТ БОЛЬ , СТРАХ , БЕСПОМОЩНЫЙ УЖАС ? ЕСЛИ ВЫ ЯВЛЯЕТЕСЬ ПРЕДСТАВИТЕЛЕМ КАКОЙ-ЛИБО ИЗ ЭТИХ КОМПАНИЙ И СЧИТАЕТЕ , ЧТО В СПИСКЕ ЕСТЬ НЕТОЧНОСТЬ ИЛИ ВАША КОМПАНИЯ УЖЕ ПРЕКРАТИЛА ПРАКТИКОВАТЬ ЖЕСТОКИЕ ИСПЫТАНИЯ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ , СООБЩИТЕ , ПОЖАЛУЙСТА , ОБ ЭТОМ НА ЭЛЕКТРОННУЮ ПОЧТУ FORGOTTENANIMALSRUSSIA @ GMAIL.COM , И МЫ ИСКЛЮЧИМ ВАС ИЗ ЭТОГО СПИСКА .

УЖЕ СЕГОДНЯ МНОГИЕ РОССИЙСКИЕ ПРОИЗВОДИТЕЛИ КОСМЕТИКИ И ПАРФЮМЕРИИ ПРЕКРАТИЛИ ТЕСТЫ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ БЛАГОДАРЯ ТОМУ , ЧТО ЭТО СТАЛО ВОЗМОЖНО . ИНИЦИИРУЙТЕ ПАРТНЕРСТВО С ГОСУДАРСТВЕННЫМИ ОРГАНАМИ , СПОСОБНЫМИ ПОВЛИЯТЬ НА ВВЕДЕНИЕ ПОЛНОГО ЗАПРЕТА НА ТЕСТИРОВАНИЕ ПАРФЮМЕРНО-КОСМЕТИЧЕСКОЙ ПРОДУКЦИИ И БЫТОВОЙ ХИМИИ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ , ЧТОБЫ ВАШИ КОМПАНИИ ПРИОБРЕЛИ РЕПУТАЦИЮ ОРГАНИЗАЦИЙ , КОТОРЫЕ УВАЖАЮТ МНЕНИЕ ПОТРЕБИТЕЛЯ , БЛАГОПОЛУЧИЕ ВСЕХ ЖИВЫХ СУЩЕСТВ И ГОТОВЫ К ДИАЛОГУ С ПРОГРЕССИВНЫМ ОБЩЕСТВОМ .

ПОДОБНЫЕ ПРИМЕРЫ ПОКАЗЫВАЮТ , ЧТО ВИВИСЕКЦИЯ НЕ ЯВЛЯЕТСЯ НЕОБХОДИМОЙ , И ЕЕ МОЖНО УСТРАНИТЬ , ЕСЛИ ТОЛЬКО У УЧЕНЫХ И ПРОИЗВОДИТЕЛЕЙ ЕСТЬ НЕОБХОДИМАЯ МОТИВАЦИЯ . НЕМНОГО « ЖИВЫХ » ДЕТАЛЕЙ О ВИВИСЕКЦИИ , ИЛИ О ЧЕМ ПЛАЧУТ КРОЛИКИ ТРУДНО НАЙТИ ЛУЧШУЮ ИЛЛЮСТРАЦИЮ БЕССМЫСЛЕННОСТИ И ДИКОСТИ ВИВИСЕКЦИИ , ЧЕМ ТЕСТ ДРАЙЗА . ДЛЯ ИЗМЕРЕНИЯ ТОКСИЧНОСТИ НА ГЛАЗА ЖИВОТНЫХ , НАХОДЯЩИХСЯ В СОЗНАНИИ , НАНОСЯТ ШАМПУНИ , ПЕСТИЦИДЫ , СРЕДСТВА ОТ СОРНЯКОВ , ГЛАЗНЫЕ ВЕЩЕСТВА , БЫТОВЫЕ МОЮЩИЕ СРЕДСТВА , ДАЖЕ СЛЕЗОТОЧИВЫЕ ГАЗЫ . ВЫБОР КРОЛИКОВ НЕ ОБУСЛОВЛЕН КАКИМИ-ЛИБО НАУЧНЫМИ СООБРАЖЕНИЯМИ , ПРОСТО ОНИ СТОЯТ ДЕШЕВО , ДОСТУПНЫ , НЕАГРЕССИВНЫ , И У НИХ БОЛЬШИЕ ГЛАЗА , ЧТО УПРОЩАЕТ ОЦЕНКУ РЕЗУЛЬТАТОВ . НА САМОМ ДЕЛЕ КРОЛИЧИЙ ГЛАЗ – ЭТО ПЛОХАЯ МОДЕЛЬ ЧЕЛОВЕЧЕСКОГО ГЛАЗА , И В НАУЧНОЙ ЛИТЕРАТУРЕ ДАННЫЙ ТЕСТ ЧАСТО КРИТИКОВАЛСЯ ( R.SHARPE , FOOD & CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY , 1985 , VOL.23 , 139-143 ) . НО ТЕСТ ДРАЙЗА НЕ ТОЛЬКО ИЛЛЮСТРИРУЕТ НЕКОТОРЫЕ ИЗ НАИХУДШИХ АСПЕКТОВ НАУЧНОЙ ПРАКТИКИ , ОН ТАКЖЕ ПОКАЗЫВАЕТ , КАК БОРОТЬСЯ С ВИВИСЕКЦИЕЙ . ПОТОМУ ЧТО ПОЛОЖЕНИЕ НАЧАЛО МЕНЯТЬСЯ В 1980-Е ГОДЫ , КОГДА ОРГАНИЗАЦИИ ПО ЗАЩИТЕ ЖИВОТНЫХ СКОНЦЕНТРИРОВАЛИ ВНИМАНИЕ НА ТЕСТЕ . ЧЕРЕЗ 10 ЛЕТ ИСПОЛЬЗОВАЛИСЬ ЛИБО НАХОДИЛИСЬ В СТАДИИ РАЗРАБОТКИ 60 МЕТОДИК РАБОТЫ В ПРОБИРКЕ , И НЕКОТОРЫЕ КОМПАНИИ ПЕРЕСТАЛИ ИСПОЛЬЗОВАТЬ КРОЛИКОВ ( C.G.SHAYNE BENCHMARKS : ALTERNATIVE METHODS TOXICOLOGY , ED . M.A.MELLMAN ( PRINCETON SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING CO.INC. , 1989 ) . В БРИТАНИИ , ГДЕ ЕЖЕГОДНО ФИКСИРУЕТСЯ ЧИСЛО ЭКСПЕРИМЕНТОВ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ , ИСПОЛЬЗОВАНИЕ КРОЛИКОВ В ТЕСТАХ НА РАЗДРАЖИМОСТЬ ГЛАЗА СОКРАТИЛОСЬ С 13000 В 1980 ГОДУ ДО 3242 В 1992 . ЭТО ДОКАЗЫВАЕТ , ЧТО , ЕСЛИ НАПРАВИТЬ ОБЩЕСТВЕННОЕ ДАВЛЕНИЕ В НУЖНОЕ РУСЛО , ЭТО ВЛИЯЕТ НА ПРОЦЕССЫ В НАУКЕ И ПРОИЗВОДСТВЕ . ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ НИЧЕМУ НЕ УЧАТ НАС О ЗДОРОВЬЕ ЧЕЛОВЕКА , ПОТОМУ ЧТО ЖИВОТНЫЕ РАЗНЫХ ВИДОВ ПОГЛОЩАЮТ , МЕТАБОЛИЗИРУЮТ И ВЫВОДЯТ ВЕЩЕСТВА ИНАЧЕ , ЧЕМ ЛЮДИ . ПРАВДА В ТОМ , ЧТО ТЕСТИРОВАНИЕ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ В РЕАЛЬНОСТИ ВОВСЕ НЕ ЯВЛЯЕТСЯ НАУЧНЫМ : ОНО НЕНАДЕЖНО И СОВЕРШЕННО НЕ НУЖНО . СТОРОННИКИ ВИВИСЕКЦИИ ЧАСТО ПОДЧЕРКИВАЮТ , ЧТО В БОЛЬШЕЙ ЧАСТИ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЙ ИСПОЛЬЗУЮТСЯ КРЫСЫ , МЫШИ И КРОЛИКИ , А НЕ , СКАЖЕМ , КОШКИ И СОБАКИ . ЭТО ДЕЛАЕТСЯ ПОТОМУ , ЧТО ЛЮДИ МЕНЬШЕ БУДУТ ВОЗРАЖАТЬ , ПОТОМУ ЧТО ГРЫЗУНЫ НЕ ОЧЕНЬ ПОПУЛЯРНЫ СРЕДИ БОЛЬШИНСТВА . КРОМЕ ТОГО , ИХ ЛЕГКО КОРМИТЬ , ЗА НИМИ ПРОСТО УХАЖИВАТЬ И РАБОТАТЬ С НИМИ НЕТРУДНО ; ОНИ ДОСТУПНЫ И ДЕШЕВЫ . НО ЭТА ТАКТИКА МОЖЕТ ПРИВЕСТИ К НЕОЖИДАННЫМ НЕПРИЯТНЫМ ПОСЛЕДСТВИЯМ , ПОТОМУ ЧТО ОПОРА НА ЭТИХ ЖИВОТНЫХ СЛУЖИТ ОЧЕНЬ СИЛЬНЫМ АРГУМЕНТОМ ПРОТИВ ЗАЯВЛЕНИЯ , ЧТО ВИВИСЕКЦИЯ КАКИМ-ТО ОБРАЗОМ НАУЧНА . О КАКОЙ НАУЧНОСТИ МОЖНО ГОВОРИТЬ , КОГДА ВЫБОР ВИДОВ ТАК ЧАСТО ЗАВИСИТ ОТ ТАКИХ НЕНАУЧНЫХ ФАКТОРОВ , КАК ЦЕНА И УДОБСТВО ? НЕКОТОРЫЕ КОМПАНИИ УТВЕРЖДАЮТ , ЧТО ОНИ ДОЛЖНЫ ТЕСТИРОВАТЬ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ , ПОТОМУ ЧТО ОНИ ПРОДАЮТ СВОЮ ПРОДУКЦИЮ В ТАКИХ СТРАНАХ , КАК КИТАЙ , ГДЕ ТЕСТИРОВАНИЕ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ ВСЕ ЕЩЕ ТРЕБУЕТСЯ ПО ЗАКОНУ ДЛЯ КОМПАНИЙ , ИМПОРТИРУЮЩИХ В СТРАНУ . НО НА САМОМ ДЕЛЕ ЭТО НЕ ТАК . ОНИ РЕШИЛИ ПРОДАВАТЬ В КИТАЕ , ЗНАЯ , ЧТО ЭТО БУДЕТ ОЗНАЧАТЬ НОВЫЕ ИСПЫТАНИЯ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ . ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КОСМЕТИЧЕСКОЕ ТЕСТИРОВАНИЕ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ НЕ ЗАКАНЧИВАЕТСЯ . ПОСКОЛЬКУ ЭКСПЕРИМЕНТЫ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ ЯВЛЯЮТСЯ ЖЕСТОКИМИ , ДОРОГОСТОЯЩИМИ И , КАК ПРАВИЛО , НЕПРИМЕНИМЫМИ К ЧЕЛОВЕКУ , САМЫЕ ДАЛЬНОВИДНЫЕ УЧЕНЫЕ МИРА ПЕРЕШЛИ К РАЗРАБОТКЕ И ИСПОЛЬЗОВАНИЮ МЕТОДОВ ИЗУЧЕНИЯ БОЛЕЗНЕЙ И ТЕСТИРОВАНИЯ ПРОДУКТОВ , КОТОРЫЕ ЗАМЕНЯЮТ ЖИВОТНЫХ И ДЕЙСТВИТЕЛЬНО ИМЕЮТ ОТНОШЕНИЕ К ЗДОРОВЬЮ ЧЕЛОВЕКА . ЭТИ АЛЬТЕРНАТИВЫ ТЕСТИРОВАНИЮ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ ВКЛЮЧАЮТ СЛОЖНЫЕ ТЕСТЫ С ИСПОЛЬЗОВАНИЕМ ЧЕЛОВЕЧЕСКИХ КЛЕТОК И ТКАНЕЙ ( МЕТОДЫ VITRO ) , ПЕРЕДОВЫЕ МЕТОДЫ КОМПЬЮТЕРНОГО МОДЕЛИРОВАНИЯ ( МОДЕЛИ SILICO ) И ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ С УЧАСТИЕМ ДОБРОВОЛЬЦЕВ-ЛЮДЕЙ . ЭТИМ И ДРУГИМ НЕЖИВОТНЫМ МЕТОДАМ НЕ МЕШАЮТ ВИДОВЫЕ РАЗЛИЧИЯ , КОТОРЫЕ ДЕЛАЮТ ПРИМЕНЕНИЕ РЕЗУЛЬТАТОВ ИСПЫТАНИЙ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ К ЛЮДЯМ ТРУДНЫМ ИЛИ НЕВОЗМОЖНЫМ , И ОНИ ОБЫЧНО ЗАНИМАЮТ МЕНЬШЕ ВРЕМЕНИ И ДЕНЕГ . ПРОСТОЙ ФАКТ : КОГДА ИССЛЕДОВАТЕЛИ НЕ МОГУТ ИСПОЛЬЗОВАТЬ ЖИВОТНЫХ , ОНИ ВСЕГДА НАХОДЯТ ВОЗМОЖНОСТЬ ДЛЯ ДОСТИЖЕНИЯ ЦЕЛЕЙ ИСПОЛЬЗОВАТЬ ДРУГИЕ МЕТОДЫ . НЕОБХОДИМОСТЬ СТАНОВИТСЯ МАТЕРЬЮ ИЗОБРЕТЕНИЯ . НАПРИМЕР , ХОТЯ ЖИВОТНЫЕ ТРАДИЦИОННО ИСПОЛЬЗУЮТСЯ ДЛЯ ПРОВЕРКИ ЭФФЕКТИВНОСТИ ВАКЦИН , ЭТОТ ПОДХОД НЕ СРАБОТАЛ ПРИ ОЦЕНКЕ ВАКЦИНЫ ОТ ПНЕВМОНИИ , ПОТОМУ ЧТО ОРГАНИЗМЫ , ВЫЗЫВАЮЩИЕ ЕЕ , НЕ ДЕЙСТВУЮТ НА ЛАБОРАТОРНЫХ ЖИВОТНЫХ . В РЕЗУЛЬТАТЕ УЧЕНЫЕ РАЗРАБОТАЛИ АЛЬТЕРНАТИВНЫЙ МЕТОД , ОСНОВАННЫЙ НА ХИМИЧЕСКОМ АНАЛИЗЕ И РАБОТЕ С ДОБРОВОЛЬЦАМИ ( J.B.ROBBINS , JOURNAL INFECTION , 1979 , VOL.1 , SUPPL.2 , 61-72 ) . ЕСЛИ МЫ ХОТИМ , ЧТОБЫ КОСМЕТИЧЕСКОЕ ТЕСТИРОВАНИЕ НА ЖИВОТНЫХ БЫЛО КОГДА-НИБУДЬ ЗАПРЕЩЕНО И В НАШЕЙ СТРАНЕ , А КОСМЕТИЧЕСКИЕ КОМПАНИИ УЖЕ СЕЙЧАС ОТКАЗАЛИСЬ ОТ ЭТИХ СРЕДНЕВЕКОВЫХ ( НЕСМОТРЯ НА ЦИВИЛИЗОВАННУЮ ОБЕРТКУ И ГЛЯНЕЦ ) ПРАКТИК , ТО НАМ НУЖНО ОБЪЕДИНИТЬСЯ . ПОДПИСЫВАЯ ЭТУ ПЕТИЦИЮ , ВЫ ДЕЛАЕТЕ ШАГ К ПРЕКРАЩЕНИЮ СТРАДАНИЙ МИЛЛИОНОВ ЖИВОТНЫХ ЧЕРЕЗ ИСПОЛЬЗОВАНИЕ ГОРАЗДО БОЛЕЕ БЕЗОПАСНЫХ И ГУМАННЫХ МЕТОДОВ ТЕСТИРОВАНИЯ .
